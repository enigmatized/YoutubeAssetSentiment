1,mmMIusfGcOc, so maybe you've heard about meme stocks and if you haven't this is either your first very very first day in the markets or you've been living under a rock today we're going to talk about meme stocks and why you should care and why it's going to be the theme for quite some time [Music] hey everyone lee train with stocks of trade tim bowen here be sure to like subscribe and share these videos with your friends um you know i talk about the democratization of trading so much i mean listen trading's been opening up opening up opening up getting more and more accessible to joe and jane everyday trader for the last couple years but now with this democratization this you know open access to information a super computer in your pocket commission free trading there's never been a better time to get into trading so ring that bell to be notified every time we go live every time we drop a podcast we're putting out a bunch of great information here and if you're really ready to take your trading the next level check out the steady trade team i do twice daily webinars every single trading day there is so much going on right now i tell you the biggest issue the it's funny how things have flipped because it used to be as a new trader one of your biggest impediments to success was lack of information it's the opposite now there is so much going on so much information out there it's coming at you from everywhere heck your grandma's probably talking to you about stocks right now okay steady trade team we filter it all down twice daily live webinars and focus on what really matters check out the steady trade team look forward to working with you all right so meme stocks uh you know diamond hands together apes are strong to the moon you know all these memes and things you've been seeing number one it's awesome i love it because uh you know you maybe if you listen to the podcast you know since i was a kid i've always been yeah i've called myself a stock market dork and when you're a dork when you're a nerd by the way i consider dork and nerd compliments i don't consider those derogatory terms if you're a wine nerd if you're a coffee nerd if you're a cigar nerd or a stock market nerd i consider that a compliment it just means you really love something and you love getting into all intricate details of it but that being said the memes are just amazing and it's so it makes trading so much more fun and now let's talk about how you really apply this okay how do you make some money with this that's why you're here you're trying to make some money you're trying to grow your account supplement your income pay for a vacation whatever well as much as i love the meme stocks and the whole you know diamond hands and hold the line and all this stuff what this is creating is so much opportunity for you if you are that nerd or that dork that really wants to learn this stuff okay and that's one of the things i talk about a lot that listen i don't think you should be actively day trading unless you're in love unless you're obsessed i mean i'm obsessed if you follow the channel i mean every morning every single morning i show up here rant and rave you know go nuts about the action of the day i think you can tell my passion if you listen to the podcast um you know the steady trade podcast like the number one complaint for the steady trade podcast is tim never shuts up i just love talking stocks i love this stuff and if you're that nerd and you're into this stuff there's so many more uninformed investors people that aren't putting in the time people that aren't tracking their trades they're not doing the spreadsheets at night you know they're just the yolo people and i'm not here to pass a moral judgment you know listen if young people want to throw some money at the market i'm not going to yell at him i mean listen when i was 18 19 20 the stuff i wasted money on you know putting a thousand dollar stereo in a car that was worth 500 bucks you know it's like listen i made plenty of bad decisions from 18 to 20 to 22 to 25 you know and here's the thing if you do yolo maybe you'll learn from it at least but you're not a yolo peep you're you're actually watching youtube videos you want to learn you want to get better so the point is study take advantage of this youtube channel take advantage of the podcast check out the stocks of trade blog uh you know listen there's a bunch of videos on our channel where i review books recommend books there's so much information out there and if you can be diligent and focused there's never been more dumb money out there and the dump the more dumb money there is the more the edge to the people that take it serious and listen gme amazing going from four dollars to you know 400 in the matter of um you know a few months and i mean really vertically went from 20 to 4 almost 500 in the matter of a week but we all know what most of them are gonna do none of them have a plan none of them have a stop and they might have bought it 200 300 heck they might have bought it 50 i mean and sitting on a huge unrealized gain so think about that that person that doesn't have that trade plan and they bought it at 50 and here they are up 200 a share maybe they got like 10 shares you know they got they bought 10 shares at 50 a 500 position here they are you know sitting at at 2 500 a 2 000 gain on a 500 position and they're not selling you know because they they believe the memes they believe that gamestop has long term potential they think it's going to ten thousand you know now listen anything can happen in this market but the biggest point i want to talk about is we always talk about that three to one risk to reward having realistic goals and here's the thing let's say you are and i'm not saying anybody bought you know 10 well somebody probably did but if you bought 10 shares at 50 and here you are sitting with a 400 percent gain 500 percent gain you take that gains you book it and then here's the thing if gme let's say who knows by the time this video comes out usually there's a weak lag until the video gets published you know if it breaks out at 500 we buy you can always trade in and out of these things that's the beauty of liquid stocks like this thing i mean i mean trading hundreds of millions of shares you can get in and out plenty of liquidity anytime you want so there's no reason to become that true believer or that bag holder or that trader with no plan and if you simply have a goal and a stop okay i know a lot of you are probably taking this seriously that's why you're on the channel you'd be amazed how many people they enter a trade and it's like what's your stop that i don't know you know uh i'll stop if it goes against me what's that mean and then well when are you selling what's your goal well you know i'll sell when it spikes you know and those vague you know so because the reason they're vague i mean it's some quarter it's probably some sort of psychological thing that gives them that ability to enter you know to stay in a trade when the when it when it doesn't go their way or when it does go their way and then it allows them to basically weasel out something that i've taught forever write it down on an index card and i mean i know most of us are on laptops now but back in when i would when i was getting started trading you know i had a desktop so i had the function keys on the top of my keyboard i would enter or write down my entry my goal and my stop and i would stick it in that function key row of my keyboard and it was staring me in the face so that when my stop started slipping that index card is telling me you're an idiot you're not sticking to your discipline you're not actually trading you're just hoping you're hoping it goes up you're hoping if it goes against you it bounces hope and hope and hoping you know whether it's in your favor or not in your favor and hope is not a strategy okay that is not a strategy a strategy is buying gme at 250 selling or buying it at 50 selling it at 150 selling it at 200 not holding up to 480 and then let it come all the way back to 50 or 40 or 30 or 20 or all the way back to five bucks where it started so have a trade plan stick to it build good habits okay telling you if you've ever tried to get in shape or lose weight that momentum builds day one you know you exercise and maybe you miss a day then you hit it then you do two days in a row then you do three days in a row then you start eating better then you start drinking your water and that momentum builds and all of a sudden you look back and you're 20 pounds lighter or your cardio is 10 times better or your bench is that much higher or whatever your goal is consistent daily good habits taking this seriously again i love the memes nobody loves the memes more than i do but i take this seriously it's real money it's real trading things can go bad fast just as bad as they are just as quickly as they can go good all right everyone love the memes give me a comment below what's your favorite one um i do kind of like the uh many apes or apes strong together it's one of my favorite ones but anyway have a great day everyone check out the steady trade team be serious this is gonna be the greatest year ever of trading and heck at this point when you look at the way i mean wall street bets has added like six million people this week i've done so many videos saying a year ago i was doing videos saying everyone's a trader everyone's a trader today so much opportunity and if you get that education and you build those habits i i don't think there's ever been a better time to to be in that 10 percent to succeed because of the fact that you can study and there's just so much more dumb money out there so all right everyone check out the steady trade team and i look for,meme+stock,"['so', 'maybe', 'you', 've', 'heard', 'about', 'meme', 'stocks', 'and', 'if', 'you',

6,a3WnvDtDD2M, I accidentally became a meme and this is that story my name is Andres Erato that people might know me as hide the pain Herald before taking stock photos I was working as an electric engineer my specialty was lighting technologies the stock photos began when a photographic contacted me when he saw my selfies on the social media and he was saying that he was seeking a character like me and invited me to shoot some images this happened almost 10 years ago after the first photo shoots the photographer really liked the pictures so he righted me back several times I was for instance a doctor a university professor husband a painter and many others I first realised when I had become a meme several months after the first photo shoots I was curious but my pictures were used for so I made a reverse image search and I discovered myself in different advertisements as a professor or or a doctor but some months later when I repeated that search I discovered the first mean and that was the point when I realized that I had became at first it was horrifying when I encountered the first means because there was some really rude or disgusting jokes with me so I wanted to please throw all the pictures and close down all the website that they appeared but that was not a real solution it took several years they'd like to accept the situation but it has brought me several new opportunities at first people didn't believe that I'm a real living person they thought the memes were trying to Photoshop creation when I embraced this I revealed my identity on a Russian social media site and after that I can say that for the bad or rude or disgusting needs disappeared at first I did not consider myself as famous but later more and more people stopped me on the street asking for a selfie I do this always willingly because I see the joy in the eyes of these people and it's so good to make other people happy I had the opportunity to cooperate with the biggest brands like coca-cola they invited me for a shooting when I had to fly in a wind tunnel it was very very exciting I enjoyed it very much now there is a much bigger challenge inside a comedy movie about the high the pain story my management is planning and talking with potential investors surprisingly I got lots of messages each day on my Facebook and Instagram channels from people asking for help in the everyday life I try to show to my fans that they should be happy even during the difficult times in their lives and I guess memes can have in these periods to overcome the everyday annoyances even though this unexpected event happened I still consider myself the same old guy and Roger Otto [Music],meme+stock,"['I', 'accidentally', 'became', 'a', 'meme', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'that', 'story',

KIND OF BUSINESS GAMESTOP HAS BEEN DOING IN THE PAST TWO

9,5HFehFpU_8M, there's been so much conversation around the gamestop situation over the past few weeks i mean even in romania where i live media publications have covered what happened with this insane battle between reddit users and giant wall street hedge funds if you go on a bus it's very likely you'll overhear people talking about it and it's something you've never seen before up to just a few weeks ago you could never even possibly fathom a bunch of regular guys in their underwear banding together and sticking it to the man at such a level it was so insane and so oddly satisfying now over the course of this video as we touch on financial terms and talk about the stock market i have to make it very clear that i'm not a financial advisor and i'm by no means an expert in the matter i'm simply voicing my opinions on a topic that i find really fascinating now if i were to put everything that happened into a single sentence it would be that institutions that have historically manipulated the stock market for hundreds of years got a little too greedy and when reddit users saw a  in their armor they put their collective weight to work in a way that literally squeezed the hedge funds against the wall and made them lose billions of dollars in the process here's why and how all of this happened to some extent everybody knows what the stock market is it's not really rocket science it's where public companies share a part of their valuation which investors can buy and sell small pieces of and based on the supply and demand the price of one share goes up and down in value the idea is for people to support companies they believe in and give them money so they can grow their operations while making a profit themselves along the way the stock market should at least in theory represent the epitome of meritocracy because if a company does well its market cap grows if it shows a lack of vision or fails to bring in good results it then tanks but by this point i don't think anyone truly believes this meritocracy that drives the stock market when you have billionaires and hedge funds out there manipulating the market with huge capital i mean if you just google top 10 hedge funds it's right there in plain sight davidson kempner capital management 33 billion dollars in assets under management citadel advisors 29 billion elliott management 73 billion man group i mean talk about a little creativity here these guys literally call themselves the man group they've been on the market since 1784 and they have over 117 billion dollars in assets under management so when you see these mammoths dominating the market for literally hundreds of years it should have the very least put a question mark in your mind as to whether you're really on the same boat as them in terms of influencing the market historically speaking if these guys have not approved of a particular company they've had the leverage to sink its valuation all the way down to the bottom of the ocean the way they do that is by short selling a stock for example tesla is a classic example of this in a world of internal combustion engines where a few select companies have been running the industry for over a century when elon musk sprang on the scene with his electric car it completely turned the automobile market on its head so what did the hedge funds do they weren't just gonna accept some new kid on the block putting a halt to their arrangements they started short selling tesla stock in other words they bet against tesla contrary to buying shares in a company thus driving its price up short selling is like putting a stack of bricks on the price keeping it low and the lower it goes you earn more money as the company values less the only reason it didn't work with tesla is because no matter what you do to postpone it you can't stop innovation but for many other companies short sellers often have the power to keep the stock price exactly where they want it now does that sound fair to you because that doesn't resemble meritocracy to me it just sounds like a bunch of billionaires sitting around with cigars in their mouths deciding who to let in and who to keep out of their fancy exclusive club historically there hasn't been much that you could do about it though until the internet started to get a little wiser [Music] in 2013 this guy right here vlad tenef founded a company called robin hood the mission of the app much like its name indicates was to break barriers and allow the little guy to trade even if all they had was 20 the slogan of robin hood was literally let the people trade much like the character of robin hood you know steal from the rich give to the poor this new platform revolutionized investing by allowing commission free stock trading thus bringing in a huge wave of inexperienced but eager young investors to which the stock market had been inaccessible before and probably one of the most fascinating places on the internet to sprout as a direct result of this was the subreddit r slash wall street bets stepping into that world will plunge you into a real life version of the wolf of wall street except a thousand times crazier if the regular stock market trader takes time to analyze the market researches stocks and invests steadily across decades of their life responsibly planning for their retirement the average wall street bets investor has 100 and wants to turn it into a million fast these guys have nothing to lose they call themselves degenerates and their catchphrase is yolo they don't buy stocks but instead use high leverage tactics in hope of seeing big juicy gains overnight which have a tendency did not pan out granted there's a few success stories on the subreddit such as user snakeperson123 putting in 800 and making a hundred and fifteen thousand but then there's also users like 22 yards who is down 33 000 after bedding in the wrong direction he goes how do i fix this and this other guy responds with take a green sharpie and draw a jagged line towards the upper right hand corner of the screen wall street bets has already had a history of controversial episodes and have often been cited on news stations as irresponsible trolls with no respect for the stock market but what happened in january took their profile to a completely new level so we've talked about the hedge funds about robin hood and the rise of wall street bets but the way they all come together is through gamestop i know a lot of viewers on this channel don't live in the united states so there's a big chance you're not familiar with gamestop but in america for every kid born in the late 80s early 90s gamestop was a big part of their childhood it was the biggest brick and mortar video game retailer eventually spreading even across canada australia and europe but just like netflix killed blockbuster online video game purchases made gamestop pretty irrelevant and seeing how the gamestop business model was losing popularity the wall street hedge funds like the vultures that they are started heavily short selling gamestop on the stock market so one day a reddit user on wall street bets by the name of senior hedgehog pointed out how 84 percent of shares were short meaning there was five times more power driving the stock down than there were people organically supporting the company and mind you this was posted in april of 2020 by january of 2021 the short interest percentage was over 140 percent which means more shares were being shorted than there were actual shares in circulation this was a paradox that showed how greedy the hedge funds had become and by being greedy they had become vulnerable and this time reddit was ready to teach them a lesson [Music] when you short a stock what that means essentially is that you lend someone else one share at the current price let's say ten dollars and when the price goes down let's say to seven dollars you buy it right back keeping the three dollar difference as profit but the risk here is that once you've lent out the share if the stock goes up to say fifteen dollars not only do you not make any profit but you now have to pay the five dollar difference and again 140 of gamestop shares were being lent out which is about 90 million shares so reddit users coordinated to go on the robinhood app and collectively bought gamestop stock at insane volumes driving the price from around 19 at the start of january to a whopping 480 at the highest peak this is called a short squeeze and it's not an uncommon tactic on wall street but never before has it been put into practice by regular people coming together on the internet the hedge funds got a mouthful of their own medicine and it was bitter the 90 million shares they had lent out at five to ten dollars now had to be bought back at 50 to 100 times the original price according to fortune.com by january the 29th the losses had risen to 19.75 billion dollars hedge funds had to be bailed out so as to not go bankrupt investment bank goldman sachs warned that the entire stock market could crash if reddit users didn't sell their shares in order to drive the stock price back to its original spot and as all of this madness was unfolding the biggest promoter of giving power to the people robin hood decided to restrict users from buying more gamestop stock while still allowing them to sell their current shares thus showing a clear bias in favor of the big institutions now of course liquidity played a big role in this decision robin hood themselves requiring a cash injection of 2.4 billion dollars to stay in business but to reddit this gesture was seen as the ultimate betrayal the brand of robin hood was expected to stand exactly for what wall street bets had managed to accomplish stealing from the rich and empowering the little guy instead the app was seemingly siding with the hedge funds and so vlad tenef instantly became a villain in the eyes of the people a lot of people even started wondering if robin hood didn't shut down trading at the behest of the wall street big suits there's currently lawsuits being thrown about in my opinion with high chances of doing serious damage to robin hood and vlad tenneff himself is set to testify before a u.s house committee on the 18th of february in fact by the time you're watching this that may have already happened as of me working on this video there's more confusion than we have any clear answers one thing we know is that gamestop stock seems to have returned back down close to its original price but what happened here is certainly set to change the course of the global financial world once regular people realized that together they wield a considerable amount of power against these billion dollar institutions that's a genie that you can never shove back in the bottle it's a fascinating story that i'm sure people will revisit for years to come and it's very likely that things will never be the same after this in what way exactly i guess we'll have to wait and see but let me know in the comments what your thoughts are on this entire debacle did you take part in the gamestop short squeeze and how do you see everything moving forward from here i'm very curious to read your guys's thoughts down below as always thank you for watching we'll see you again very soon [Music] [Music] [Applause]

10,3Zj6hFVPxGU, warning the MEMS used as examples in this video may be super lame and dumb they were chosen because they exhibit certain characteristics that they don't always include humor sorry in advance : open paranthesis hello everybody and welcome to part 1 of YouTube vs. The Wall Street Journal I'm just kidding we're not we're not going to go into that here we're going to be talking about the meme economy the meme economy may seem trivial perhaps you've heard of it before or come across it on the front page of Reddit actually I would be pretty surprised if you still found it on the front page because the website is basically devolved into a passive-aggressive shouting match between political subreddits if that makes any sense at all anyway I digress today it is my goal to leave you with some new insights into this upcoming and exciting concept first of all what is a meme well according to Richard Dawkins who coined the phrase it is an idea behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture it is worth noting that Dawkins definition for a meme may not actually apply to what you or I might call a meme an example of what Dawkins would consider a meme is a viral video as the video gets more and more views it is shared on social media and reaches a wider and wider audience on the other hand an internet meme in the popular sense could simply be described as an inside joke on the internet an inside joke of course could be as simple as a sign or a saying that could be used in different contexts with different words contrary to popular belief memes don't actually need to be funny clever or even original the memes we're familiar with today are typically images shared across the internet if you compare two images that exhibit the same meme side-by-side you will notice there are certain similarities between the two this could span anywhere from part of a caption to an entire image used under a common theme to a specific reaction based on the image itself the interesting part about this is that some of the memes I just showed you may have been dead for years by the time you've seen this video but I can nearly guarantee you that no matter how much time has passed as long as the Internet is allowed to grow memes as a general concept will still be thriving this cycle of life and death is actually where the meme economy comes in most of the time the subreddit is used to post memes and ask others to evaluate them a user will take a meme seen on the internet and post it on the subreddit asking if it is worth investing in other users will comment on the post and offer their thoughts value for these memes is often based on how widely circulated it is for how long it has been in circulation and the likelihood of it becoming a normally meme that is a meme only created and found money by the boring mainstream internet users typically a consensus is reached by uploading the most favored comment of insight another way the subreddit is used is to advise other users to buy memes or sell them again if a memes value as defined by the parameters listed previously is judged to be low with a high potential to rapidly increase a user may advise the community to buy into a meme on the other hand if a meme is quickly becoming highly circulated has reached a peak or it's becoming dangerously close to normal status a user will similarly advise the community to sell such memes but what do these words really mean people use words like buy and sell and invest as descriptors but their actual significance is often overlooked and this is where I believe the untapped potential in the meme economy is found you see while you may not know it when you're advising people to buy memes you're not just asking them to download them onto their computers in fact you're asking them to create them as well when people create and share memes they become circulated on social media which encourages others to create the same type of meme because normies make up the majority of the viewing audience of a meme it's important to recognize the steps you can take to prevent the meme for becoming obsolete you can share it on only platform such as 4chan where normies are not typically found or you can make the meme so hard to replicate that normies won't even bother the lifetime of a mean that is the duration it has value for is usually determined by how widely adopted it is in some cases we have memes like the ancient bad luck Brian are socially awkward penguin memes that lasted for several years while in other cases the meme dies after a day that god-awful Italian meme of March 2017 was neither popular nor funny for more than like 16 hours because it was so easy to replicate and it wasn't even very clever to begin with it just spreads so far and so fast that it wasn't sustainable it is at times like these when a meme starts to die the people on meme economy will urge others to sell their memes the technical interpretation of this is to post all memes online and then cease to produce or collect any more now the return can come in several different forms depending on the plan or on which the memes are made available on sites such as reddit the return is simply comment or post karma it gets a lot more complicated when it comes to sites such as YouTube that deal with likes and views and subscribers but it's easy enough to imagine when you think of the positive benefits associated with making the meme in the first place as the return as the name implies the meme economy shares a lot of similarities with the real world currency based economies that we're familiar with but there are a few key differences first of all there is currently no way to consistently convert the returns received from the memes into a usable currency reddit karma cannot be exchanged for goods and services hence why most people call reddit karma fake internet points and secondly there is no viewing fee for a meme on the internet they can be created shared and altered freely and yes if you want to think of time as a currency it does take time to create something original but if you happen to find a meme on 4chan for example there's nothing to stop you from copying and pasting it on reddit in a matter of seconds there are full subreddits devoted to doing just that so with all of this in mind it's sometimes hard to see the rationale for a meme economy in the first place the comparisons to a real world economy are rough and the gains from making beams are slight at best and even if you do come up with an original idea there's nothing to stop someone from stealing it anyway so basically what need is there to formalize it if you don't know the answer to this then it's best to remember the whole point of making and sharing memes in the first place unlike in finance most people don't do this for any type of personal gain when you drop a dank B when your group chat you're not trying to attract customers so you can choose to view the meme economy subreddit as a serious place like an investor or simply a subreddit that treats memes like fashion you see at the end of the day creating memes and sharing memes and creating a meme stock market it's all just something we do for fun and that concludes today's video thank you very much for watching make sure to like comment and subscribe and also share it with your meme loving friends sorry for the gaps between uploads I think the worst of that is over for now I had to grind so I could get a new camera do some freelance work I do have a new video coming soon but

11,GZFEF_Qn60A, back in 1688 a merchant called joseph delewega became one of the first to lose a fortune on the stock market he wrote it is a touchstone for the intelligent and a tombstone for audacious a treasury of usefulness and a source of disaster this quote from 300 years ago manages to describe the mood swings of an investor perfectly even though investor behavior is still the same a lot has changed since then those were the times when individuals controlled stock markets whereas today big players like hedge funds investment banks those are the ones who has the most power is that changing [Music] these stocks have gained the nickname meme stocks wait what as a meme meme this mean yes a meme stock is a stock whose value can go up wildly beyond expectations and disregards fundamentals like profits revenue or even leadership over the past years meme stocks have managed to cause powerful valuation changes in some stocks and created waves in investment circles just have a look at twitter or reddit and see how much of an impact they have over the financial markets and those players are getting stronger because of the social media and we can't ignore them anymore this part they don't have like a professional background they don't know real analysis they don't know technical analysis they don't know a real scientifical approach of analyzing any share they just buy for now meme stocks are not found in textbooks or taught in finance classes but they are becoming more and more important every day in fact look at this tweet which is self-joking but reflects the reality at the same time how do you understand if a stock is a meme stock and what are their characteristics they are usually overpriced they experience spikes of rapid growth in a very short period of time they are popular among millennials and retail investors and are based on a potential rather than their financial features fomo fear of missing out is a big motivation to buy these stocks and hype usually gives direction while panic selling occurs even during a very small headwind the classification is not clear however what we do think it might refer to is millennial investors millennials are on their social media applications and the particular brands that they might be interested in investing in so you would think about tesla let's have a look at tesla since its establishment in 2010 its shares have surged over 21 000 and this ever rising share price has created another meme songs back in june 2020 elon musk tweeted who controls to memes controls the universe and over the years musk managed to create a super loyal fanbase who would follow him anywhere which has been very helpful lately musk has been tweeting a lot on digital currencies causing massive but short-lived spikes in prices so all these stocks gamestop tesla netflix and digital currencies like bitcoin dodge quaint they're all products of memes whether they've been successfully surging over a period of time or just had a short-lived moment they should all be tanking the internet social media and memes once a famous turkish trader told me if you hear people talking about a particular stock run away from it don't ever think of investing in it is this how most professional traders feel about retail investors and are retail investors answering this mentality through meme stocks there is a new player is coming to the market it was always ignored for years and years by big world players but this game stuff saga as you called it is a proof that those this new player we can't acknowledge

metamucil he posted this and then he published a dd post which is now removed in the post he detailed political movements the country's decreasing parity between the peso and the dollar and the country's risk assessments to skyrocket naturally he reasoned that his approach would beat to short cds's or to short their current holdings of the government bonds people realized this was too

starving family in argentina hilarious he posted his next play which turned out to be a dead end onward went shopping this fine neurotypical specimen held a position for three years and had a thousand percent return arguably one of the best gains on wall street bets from shares alone he played the long game and cashed out bigly now while this game is impressive it challenges the decadent ethos of wall street bets by attributing safe and sound investing while imperviously holding your position when listen nobody wants to see tremendous gains and life-changing money next please this user unfortunately passed away his son-in-law posted so but users peeled through the post history to discover that the his sister playable moose's sister stole 250 000 from their grandmother suffering from dementia signing over her money and bought a house with the spoils mr moose filed a police report but did not give an update and yes the son-in-law mentioned that an autopsy would be performed considering the circumstances yeah he probably got murdered by his sister without evidence we will never know she made the ultimate margin call now i was going to do a few more users but i can't for

wall street bettors put their money where their mouth is and show the end results and not only is that ballsy but it's admirable like 4chan found a bloomberg terminal indeed why would you possibly drop 24k on bloom term just to have access to a bunch of suited lock jaws pointing out of technical rafts you will neither understand or garner any useful information out of when you can simply type in reddit navigate to this funny little guy and scroll endlessly through until you feel the prick of a vaccine and an overwhelming urge to trade options at earning calls i'm sure you're wondering a lot of things like why would someone throw their financial futures away in a single trade or why would anyone trade so irresponsibly for internet points the fact of the matter is looking at the vernacular suggests rampant homoeroticism cloaked in playground insults and jockish bullying mods are big gay trump is daddy sometimes if op is risk averse and cashes out on a decent game he's a [ __

money idiot and then fds fixed deposits are known as [ __ ] delights there is an error of camaraderie not found in other subreddits and wall street bets gets a lot of [ __ ] called out for being toxic or juvenile or shouting fruits pronounce that [ __ ] wet dream that's probably all true but i think people miss the point it's possible through the irony and recklessness this community is a look into the future of trading and investment strategies of the next generation of traders and money men and it's also a reflection or a parallel of the financial sector's imprudent habits and lack of oversight in the big leagues on literal wall street but not so because actual investment theses are published frequently some heavily and sensibly researched and others just rampant diarrhea posts

14,x65TDamuSHU, one of the reasons i love the stock market is because it really gets down to the core of what i think life is all about making as much money as humanly possible with complete disregard to everything else now while i'm sure philosophers might eventually be able to come up with a reason why this could be bad one reason why it's good is because it rewards business models at work punishes ones that fail and encourages competition within an industry which often leads itself to innovation and getting customers better products as an example take a look at the craft beverage industry it used to just be big companies like nestle selling tap water at a huge markup but now we have bell delphine so while the stock market either goes up or it goes down the ways you can lose money on it are nearly endless so notice that different types of people like to trade in different ways depending on how they are in real life first of all we of course have the investor this is your classic older guy who knows a thing or two about the stock market like literally one or two things and those two things are time in the market beats timing the market and dollar cost averaging if they had to get a tattoo it would say buy the dip but they would never do that because tattoos are a sin next we have the boys of wall street bets these are zoomer and millennial d gens looking to get rich or take physical delivery of 50 000 barrels of crude oil trying they trade almost exclusively options which typically results in them making several times their original buy-in in a matter of days or straight up losing it all they figured that they're only gambling with their future so nothing to lose anyway their trading strategy consists of don't [ __ ] with the mouse and getting to a stock after it's already gone up 20 in the last three days another subset of options traders is theta gang a community based around selling the contracts to the previous group their profits are consistent but low enough that no one really cares their primary gains being the feeling of intellectual superiority when using terms like iron condor calendar spread iv crush and gamma hedging next we have your silver bugs and gold bugs these are the guys looking to keep their money safe so safe that once some guy in africa digs it out of the earth and sends it over they dig a hole in their backyard and put it right back in this investor is most often associated with the prepper community who are anticipating the coming apocalypse and have their shotgun shells and seat collections ready to go in their underground bunker not all gold bugs are this extreme however is my dad would simply describe himself as waiting for the great undoing of the world financial system and the collapse of american empire very similar to gold bugs you have the people who are into cryptocurrency these guys are similar in disposition but generally younger and less doomer they don't keep gold or silver on a vault in their basement because that's where they live kept warm by enough gpus to melt greenland they're absolutely loaded but never buy anything because if they sold bitcoin for us dollars that would imply bitcoin isn't a real currency penny stock speculators if options trading is the casino then penny stocks are the scratch-offs if there's the wolves of wall street these are the sheep and you might be thinking what no i'm not a sheep but like bro it's in the movie like literally that's what the movie is about if someone posted a thread on aerotyne with a few rocket emojis you know you'd put down 3k in an instant quants these are the mit graduates with three phds who work with 20 other math geniuses on a specific machine learning algorithm in order to front run the quartz crystal in the chicago mercantile exchange's internal 24-hour clock by running a fiber optic cable that's 14 feet shorter than the closest competitor thereby reducing the distance light has to travel so he can arbitrage a quarter of a cent profit per bushel on soybean futures he makes 500k a year but secretly dreams of owning an acreage and holding a soybean in the flesh the security analysts these guys are the very detail-oriented investors who are always out to find a good deal on an undervalued stock their biggest weakness is not being able to bring themselves to buy apple even though it's outperformed their entire portfolio for the past 10 years of course we can't forget last but not least wall street this is your investment banks hedge funds and money managers big money smart money whatever you want to call it now what most people think wall street does is this looks like daryl from new hampshire just bought 15k worth of delta airlines hmm oopsie daisy but what they actually do is this bring bring springbring hi this is jp morgan client services hi can i buy 15 000 of delta airlines yeah sure there's a five dollar service fee well that's fine okay it's done thank you hello hey lehman yeah want to write one too many zeros on a piece of paper sounds [ __ ] lit bro [Music] uh hey guys i've been uh streaming a lot more recently so please come check out my twitch the link is in the description

17,mmMIusfGcOc, so maybe you've heard about meme stocks and if you haven't this is either your first very very first day in the markets or you've been living under a rock today we're going to talk about meme stocks and why you should care and why it's going to be the theme for quite some time [Music] hey everyone lee train with stocks of trade tim bowen here be sure to like subscribe and share these videos with your friends um you know i talk about the democratization of trading so much i mean listen trading's been opening up opening up opening up getting more and more accessible to joe and jane everyday trader for the last couple years but now with this democratization this you know open access to information a super computer in your pocket commission free trading there's never been a better time to get into trading so ring that bell to be notified every time we go live every time we drop a podcast we're putting out a bunch of great information here and if you're really ready to take your trading the next level check out the steady trade team i do twice daily webinars every single trading day there is so much going on right now i tell you the biggest issue the it's funny how things have flipped because it used to be as a new trader one of your biggest impediments to success was lack of information it's the opposite now there is so much going on so much information out there it's coming at you from everywhere heck your grandma's probably talking to you about stocks right now okay steady trade team we filter it all down twice daily live webinars and focus on what really matters check out the steady trade team look forward to working with you all right so meme stocks uh you know diamond hands together apes are strong to the moon you know all these memes and things you've been seeing number one it's awesome i love it because uh you know you maybe if you listen to the podcast you know since i was a kid i've always been yeah i've called myself a stock market dork and when you're a dork when you're a nerd by the way i consider dork and nerd compliments i don't consider those derogatory terms if you're a wine nerd if you're a coffee nerd if you're a cigar nerd or a stock market nerd i consider that a compliment it just means you really love something and you love getting into all intricate details of it but that being said the memes are just amazing and it's so it makes trading so much more fun and now let's talk about how you really apply this okay how do you make some money with this that's why you're here you're trying to make some money you're trying to grow your account supplement your income pay for a vacation whatever well as much as i love the meme stocks and the whole you know diamond hands and hold the line and all this stuff what this is creating is so much opportunity for you if you are that nerd or that dork that really wants to learn this stuff okay and that's one of the things i talk about a lot that listen i don't think you should be actively day trading unless you're in love unless you're obsessed i mean i'm obsessed if you follow the channel i mean every morning every single morning i show up here rant and rave you know go nuts about the action of the day i think you can tell my passion if you listen to the podcast um you know the steady trade podcast like the number one complaint for the steady trade podcast is tim never shuts up i just love talking stocks i love this stuff and if you're that nerd and you're into this stuff there's so many more uninformed investors people that aren't putting in the time people that aren't tracking their trades they're not doing the spreadsheets at night you know they're just the yolo people and i'm not here to pass a moral judgment you know listen if young people want to throw some money at the market i'm not going to yell at him i mean listen when i was 18 19 20 the stuff i wasted money on you know putting a thousand dollar stereo in a car that was worth 500 bucks you know it's like listen i made plenty of bad decisions from 18 to 20 to 22 to 25 you know and here's the thing if you do yolo maybe you'll learn from it at least but you're not a yolo peep you're you're actually watching youtube videos you want to learn you want to get better so the point is study take advantage of this youtube channel take advantage of the podcast check out the stocks of trade blog uh you know listen there's a bunch of videos on our channel where i review books recommend books there's so much information out there and if you can be diligent and focused there's never been more dumb money out there and the dump the more dumb money there is the more the edge to the people that take it serious and listen gme amazing going from four dollars to you know 400 in the matter of um you know a few months and i mean really vertically went from 20 to 4 almost 500 in the matter of a week but we all know what most of them are gonna do none of them have a plan none of them have a stop and they might have bought it 200 300 heck they might have bought it 50 i mean and sitting on a huge unrealized gain so think about that that person that doesn't have that trade plan and they bought it at 50 and here they are up 200 a share maybe they got like 10 shares you know they got they bought 10 shares at 50 a 500 position here they are you know sitting at at 2 500 a 2 000 gain on a 500 position and they're not selling you know because they they believe the memes they believe that gamestop has long term potential they think it's going to ten thousand you know now listen anything can happen in this market but the biggest point i want to talk about is we always talk about that three to one risk to reward having realistic goals and here's the thing let's say you are and i'm not saying anybody bought you know 10 well somebody probably did but if you bought 10 shares at 50 and here you are sitting with a 400 percent gain 500 percent gain you take that gains you book it and then here's the thing if gme let's say who knows by the time this video comes out usually there's a weak lag until the video gets published you know if it breaks out at 500 we buy you can always trade in and out of these things that's the beauty of liquid stocks like this thing i mean i mean trading hundreds of millions of shares you can get in and out plenty of liquidity anytime you want so there's no reason to become that true believer or that bag holder or that trader with no plan and if you simply have a goal and a stop okay i know a lot of you are probably taking this seriously that's why you're on the channel you'd be amazed how many people they enter a trade and it's like what's your stop that i don't know you know uh i'll stop if it goes against me what's that mean and then well when are you selling what's your goal well you know i'll sell when it spikes you know and those vague you know so because the reason they're vague i mean it's some quarter it's probably some sort of psychological thing that gives them that ability to enter you know to stay in a trade when the when it when it doesn't go their way or when it does go their way and then it allows them to basically weasel out something that i've taught forever write it down on an index card and i mean i know most of us are on laptops now but back in when i would when i was getting started trading you know i had a desktop so i had the function keys on the top of my keyboard i would enter or write down my entry my goal and my stop and i would stick it in that function key row of my keyboard and it was staring me in the face so that when my stop started slipping that index card is telling me you're an idiot you're not sticking to your discipline you're not actually trading you're just hoping you're hoping it goes up you're hoping if it goes against you it bounces hope and hope and hoping you know whether it's in your favor or not in your favor and hope is not a strategy okay that is not a strategy a strategy is buying gme at 250 selling or buying it at 50 selling it at 150 selling it at 200 not holding up to 480 and then let it come all the way back to 50 or 40 or 30 or 20 or all the way back to five bucks where it started so have a trade plan stick to it build good habits okay telling you if you've ever tried to get in shape or lose weight that momentum builds day one you know you exercise and maybe you miss a day then you hit it then you do two days in a row then you do three days in a row then you start eating better then you start drinking your water and that momentum builds and all of a sudden you look back and you're 20 pounds lighter or your cardio is 10 times better or your bench is that much higher or whatever your goal is consistent daily good habits taking this seriously again i love the memes nobody loves the memes more than i do but i take this seriously it's real money it's real trading things can go bad fast just as bad as they are just as quickly as they can go good all right everyone love the memes give me a comment below what's your favorite one um i do kind of like the uh many apes or apes strong together it's one of my favorite ones but anyway have a great day everyone check out the steady trade team be serious this is gonna be the greatest year ever of trading and heck at this point when you look at the way i mean wall street bets has added like six million people this week i've done so many videos saying a year ago i was doing videos saying everyone's a trader everyone's a trader today so much opportunity and if you get that education and you build those habits i i don't think there's ever been a better time to to be in that 10 percent to succeed because of the fact that you can study and there's just so much more dumb money out there so all right everyone check out the steady trade team and i look for,meme+stock+trading,"['so', 'maybe', 'you', 've', 'heard', 'about', 'meme', 'stocks', 'and', 'if',

21,UOVlvdP84i8," Trading meme review! hey guys welcome to another video my name is Mohsen and this video is gonna be a little bit special
it's gonna be a more fun video finally compared to the other ones you know and
also by the way i have a special announcement to make at the end of the
video so make sure to stick around for that so, without any further ado let's do it
first meme when you bought Bitcoin at 19,000 plus and check the price today I
was told there would be Lambos yeah you know it has to start to be like the
guy who bought really at the top on like the topest topest topest price on the
charts but yeah I don't know what's the Lambo thing about everybody in crypto
wants a lambo but why would you want to spend your money on that next meme
hour here is 7 years on earth good we can HODL here... so actually thats a pretty good one up so imagine you can actually travel somewhere where time goes by slower your invest here you go there you spend a few hours you come back lambos not bad real
profit app was supposed to make me real profits if there's any app that you're
using that has the name the word profit in it or money or whatever you're
definitely gonna lose you know apps are there to help you do something you're
not necessarily gonna make profits out of them right there's a large percentage
of traders who lose so the fact that they're trying to lure you by promising
your profits means it's a bad app. HODL okay so this is Angelina Jolie right I think
she was beautiful back then too it's not like she was it wasn't beautiful and
she's beautiful yeah I don't know about this meme I feel this was a beautiful
girl is a beautiful woman that's all with women is the same thing as an
investment or men right we're getting into a position or the long-term right
so you got to make sure that it's something that's gonna
mature well. Next meme: A stock market crash is worse than divorce you lose
half your money and your wife is still around.  I don't know about these memes, 
you know to be honest I prefer if I'm getting a divorce that my wife not be
around,  because I've been through some major crashes and a stock market crash it
about 50% that's what you're gonna lose so it's the same amount of money that
you lose in a divorce but at least you just lost it and that's it you don't
have to keep paying for somebody that you don't like anymore really
I would prefer my wife not to be around if we're getting a divorce. Next meme: honey
come to bed, sorry babe we gotta protect our Bitcoin yeah if you're actually
doing this correctly where you're not leaving your cryptocurrencies on an
exchange and every time you trade you put them back in your wallet
it's super time-consuming I can understand this picture but yeah
otherwise you think the risk so it's a risk reward
you gotta risk either your money or your relationship. Next meme: Can't wait till
Monday who says that? so i if you're a new day trader I remember when I started day trading at
this firm called the WTS we were market making and I was still new right so I
wasn't good in the beginning every time we had Friday I was so sad I was like I
couldn't wait till Monday to prove myself you know nowadays I like
a lot of time off I love time off but when you're starting off you're just and
you're young you're younger just eager to prove yourself so yeah I can I can
relate. So you're a day trader I too like to live dangerously. You know that's one
thing with day trading if you're day trading you're taking a lot of risk all
right so for example me I don't take any
other risks except in trading you don't want to go on vacation I do bungee
jump  i don't skydive I don't I don't drive a motorcycle I don't do any of
these things where there's some risk because I feel that i'm
already taking so much why take some more? so I think day traders yeah they do
take some risks but in the other places in their life they
don't live dangerously they're super safe that's what I would think.
Next meme: Discovers 60 second binary options wipes out in 60 seconds. OMG... I
don't know how many people get caught with binary options this is the worst
thing you can tradee,  binary options. The amount of stories that I've heard where
people like and even from girls I met a few girls who traded or invested in
binary options I don't know why but they find it alluring where they say okay
well it's very easy there's a button called and says buy a button that says
sell and that's it I'll make money but your percentage of winning through
binary options is so minimal and these companies are really really bad they're
just gonna convince you to put up as much money as as possible even though
the probability of you succeeding is minimal never do binary options it's the
worst thing if it seems too easy then you're not gonna make money.  F irst time
they trading with 2k and it's gone I lost my first trading account most
people I know blew their first trading account this is why I highly suggest to
start with paper trading I think we all say that but there's very few people who
actually do it there's so certain of their success that they're not gonna paper 
trade first but the thing is you don't know if the first strategy you're
gonna try is gonna work the second the thrid the fourth the fifth maybe it's
gonna take you a while to find a strategy that works and for you to like
implemented correctly so start with paper trading don't start with live
money, Well if you start with live money starting a small account my account that
I started with initially was a thousand I blew it so good thing that I only
started with that right don't start off with your life savings - that would
just be gambling yeah this happens to so many people so if you can try to avoid
it please do. Next meme"" Hello mom YEAH is my old room still available yeah this is
when you go through a huge crash the first time you go through a huge crash and
you don't have any money saved up and you just once you do this long enough you
start realizing that you're gonna go through some peaks and throughs it's part
of the game right this is what you signed up for. Spending
$20 at the grocery store spending $2,000 oh yeah I guess when you're when you're
just spending money so for example for me I don't have a car I don't like to
waste my money on depreciating assets anything that is just going to lose
value groceries I don't mind I spent actually groceries and food is the thing
that I spent the most money on because I feel it's good for my
health so I'll spend it on that but then when it comes to investing you know it's
an investment you have a high probability of it yielding a good return
for you so it's easy to spend money on investing that I can relate to. But spend money on
food guys it's important. Next meme: Told you see TVIX was a buy at $30 wrote LMAO
when you texted him it fell to $2 yeah douchebag alert yeah some some people
are always telling you buy this buy that and then when it just tanks by 50% can
you see that it's like oh what? what happened? LOL  Next meme: She thinks he's
cheating actually day trading at night in Asia
yeah yeah this is no this one of the hard things is balancing a relationship
with trading I haven't been great at it I've been really bad at that one of the
firm's I worked at here they wanted to implement it you know 24-hour trading
and I was testing it for them so I started trading a few of these markets
you can actually go on I think 24-hour clock market calm and you can see which
market is open at which hour and you can literally trade 24 hours a day if
you want by trading you know Australian Stock Exchange Japanese stock exchange
European stock exchanges there's so many of them and each of them opens at
different times so you can just keep trading but I don't really like trading
at night I prefer trading early in the morning it's not a good live balance like
you might do it in the beginning if your situation and if your energy level
permits it but after you do it a few years you really get tired from doing it
and you know if you're trading let's say the Asian market, stocks there they're
numbered the name of the stocks are numbers the news you gotta like use
google translate there's not as many resources as you know what you used to I
guess if you if you are you know a local if you live in the country you're
trading it's easy to understand these news and it's easy to understand
companies but trading in a completely different country it's a bit harder than
trading in the country that you live in. just because of the information of that
stuff so yeah next meme: When stock market closed on weekends yeah I guess that's
like the other meme I guess this is a good meme to write stuff on this from Pablo
Escobar right so I guess we put any type of words on there it would make sense
Stock market closed, you're just waiting or doing some analysis don't
wait just do analysis. Demo trading versus live training trader
transformation yeah the funny thing is when you're starting off as a
trader and you go to work like in a nice suit or you're dressed up and you're
clean-shaven you're ready to be professional and a few years in and
you just walk in your t-shirt and you're not thinking about any of these other
thing the only thing you're thinking about is trading all the positions you
have all the orders you have what you have at this time what news is coming
out when you're just a hundred percent focused on trading so yeah you tend to
 like forget about all the other things it's not about the looks anymore
it's more about with actually doing the trading you don't you're programming or
coding things for trading and you're gonna look like this and not like this
this is just for sure next meme :Me picking which altcoins to
invest in. yeah this is that minesweeper so if you've never played minesweeper
this I only played a long time ago when we didn't really have other games
so when you click on one of these things there could be a bomb I believe and it
just explodes so yeah if that's how it is in investing in altcoins I think it's
something like 80% of altcoins go to zero if you look like way back let's say
four years ago the altcoins that were there and then a few years
later most of them just disappear so yeah altcoins that we have now a lot
of them are  going to disappear, that's what it feels like when you're investing
in altcoins you gotta really make sure that you're investing in a good project solid
team solid foundation as you know you gotta make sure it's a it's a good
project next meme: 90% of retail traders lose 90% of their
money in 90 days so you're telling me there's a chance yeah yeah
that's exactly the right percentages see now this is a really hard subject to
talk about because you don't for me when somebody tells me I want to trade and I
know the likelihood of success is so low it's hard for me to tell them don't do
it we'll do it because you know they could be in the top ten percent and
succeed but there's you know there's 90 percent chance that they don't but it's
the same thing in every industry you know if you open a restaurant which I
have a bunch of friends who opened restaurants and out of those I think
almost all of them except one have failed because 90% of restaurants fail
does that mean you shouldn't open a restaurant
no if you want to start a tech company you know a huge percentage of tech
companies fail if you start any type of company so if you're doing anything
really you have like a 90 percent chance of feeling it's just I don't know why
people think that I'm treating they're all gonna succeed it's like any other
business high percentage of failure every single business is that. so yeah my
suggestion is just do what you love so example if I went and opened the
restaurant I  for sure would be one of the 90% to fail because I don't have the
the traits to be good at it I'm not as good with people I'm not going to do it
with some of the things that you're gonna need to be good at to have a
restaurant to make it hip to make it look good I'm not good at these things so
I will fail, I'm good at math, computer science logic so I'm good in trading I
say if you want to do trading or if you want to open a restaurant if you want to
do whatever it is as long as you love it it's something that you want to do then
go for it but if you're if you don't necessarily love it and you just want to
do it for the money then don't do it it's not going to work, that's what i have to say. Next
meme: Dinner with candles, no, dinner with candles. This is not good candles to be
having dinner with and with some ramen noodles haha when you have a bad streak and you
start saving money on other stuff yeah that's bad
I'd prefer this this better now honestly next meme: When you have been bragging to
your friends about crypto and then a market crash occures. the crypto market
haha yeah it's doing well anyways I gotta go
I guess we all kind of did that right 2017 was an amazing year everybody that
had anything to do with crypto had a beautiful year 2018 nobody is talking 
including you know positions that I had I actually had a huge amount of money on
quadriga and they went bankrupt,  100% of the money on quadriga was lost my own
bitrail 100% of the money on bitrail was lost so a bunch of like things like
that that happened that we just don't talk about but it's part of the risk if
you're in any type of financial market you have to watch out for anything you
get lessons out of that for crypto especially you have to be very careful
with where you place your money because some of these exchanges do go bust, so
you have to keep your money on your wallet or you have to really diversify
and you gotta have money on like ten or twelve different exchanges so if one of
them goes bust you still have the others yeah a crypto crash is huge but
if you're in crypto you're gonna be in it for the long run  and you gotta have
those positions for the long run yeah this is something that happens. This
is not one guy running this should be like hundred guys running like this
everybody. Next meme: indicators Add clarity to your chart analysis oh my god I
see so many people with charts that look ridiculous have like hundreds of lines
hundred of  things and this is really when I know that somebody really doesn't
know what they're doing because every place I've worked five different firms
all the hundreds of traders that I've met that are doing really well
you use very few indicators just a few that's it you don't need to use all it's
not like if you're stacking indicators you're gonna give you better odds if
they all align doesn't work that way you know if you have too many indicators I
think in an excess of five or something and that's not just for trading it's a
across the board and anything if you're trying to predict whether if you're
trying to predict anything you start losing predictive value as you add more
variables to your equation so something like five is the max after that you
start losing predictive value so yeah stop leering at indicators. I'm hard forking
Judaism new consensus mechanism I am the truth that's actually a good one
so in cryptocurrencies what you have is you have your blockchain and you know it
operates in a specific way and if let's say the community wants to add the
future but some of the community doesn't well what they do is they just fork you
do a hard fork where they copy the blockchain and just continue on that
chain with the new way of operating so then you're going to have two different
points go in different ways where the new coin hard forked is continuing and
then it just says we are the truth from now on so we're gonna continue on this
path you guys continue on that path I guess this is what it's say here we had
judaism and then christianity came it's like hey this was okay we're keeping the
past but the future we're gonna have a new set of rules that's we're gonna
operate on which is pretty funny okay next meme waiting for my bags to rise in
value so I can get that lambo yeah again this meme yeah okay yeah this is the

23,2n4yoL3HH-M," - I'm not a trader but I follow a subreddit on
Reddit called Wall Street bets. I hear that GameStop is going to rise. So I have a little saved up. I decide, Hey, I'm gonna
buy a stock call option. That's like buying a hundred
shares of a stock on layaway. You just need a fraction
of the amount of money it would take to actually buy 100 shares. The trading day is just starting. I'm betting that the
stock is going to rise but suddenly the website crashes,
the phone lines are down. I can't get in touch with anyone and my trades are not going through. So I forget about it and I go along my day, make some coffee. And then I look back at the site. Somehow my account is down $9,000. That's more than I even had in it. - Investing in options
is wildly dangerous. You can lose an extremely
large amount of money or be down in position an
extremely large amount of money in a very short amount of time. - Everyone loves the story of
a little guy taking on the man which is why GameStop's
story to a peak stock value of 480 plus dollars was
front page news for days. It'll be featured in forthcoming films and even Congress is taking
a closer look at the action. But what's overlooked is the
tremendous amount of risk retail investors, small
people like you and I take on when entering into a market
with so much volatility. It's a story of math but it's also one of the
emerging technologies. Before we talk about what's happened, let's go over to Gamestop
and see how they're doing. Gamestop. Let's go. So, this is my local Gamestop and apparently they
closed just last month. And that isn't a one-off
because in the last two years, they've closed more than 700 shops with more closures to come. GameStop's brick and
mortar retail business is in the dumpster. This company's once high
flying stock was trading below 10 bucks a share for all of last year. In just a few weeks, it had suddenly doubled, tripled,
went up 10 times in price and it was still going. How was this possible? Ever since the pandemic
downturn in early 2020 the stock market has done quite well. And millions of everyday traders, new traders, have decided to take a turn of rolling the dice at the market. And then a group of Redditors saw that there was enormous interest in short selling certain stocks by Wall Street hedge fund firms
that have a lot of money. Shorting is a bet that
a stock will go down. These hedge funds were
targeting businesses in trouble. This include stocks like AMC theaters, bed, bath and
beyond and of course, GameStop. That caused Redditors to decide
to target the hedge funds. And it's still happening today. - Wall Street bets is a community that's been around for a little while and it's always been kind of an irreverent neolistic
investment community where people went for
big gains and big losses and strong positions and hilarious memes. And you would buy stock if you thought a meme was
super great, just cause, I mean, what did you have to lose? - This is Madison Darbyshire. She covers retail investing
trends for the Financial Times. Reddit users are not a monolith but many of them got together
to coordinate large purchases of the stock and hold them. This led to many who had short positions, who were betting that
the stocks would go down to have to buy more to cover their bets, which forced more short sellers to get out of their losing
positions by buying more. It's hard to overstate
how high the interest of these stocks got on
the week of January 25th. The Wall Street bet subreddit grew by millions of subscribers. My Barber had stock options. Even my therapist said
that she bought Gamestop. Sebastian Castillo is one of the people who recently began trading again. - Hey, everybody. - He plays the options
on the Robinhood app, a much riskier form of trading. - The bet I made for
$600 is now worth $70. - An option is a contract
that gives you the right to buy or sell 100 shares
at the price you choose. That's called the strike price. For example, if you buy a call
option of Gamestop at $100 it gives you the right to
buy 100 shares at any time between the moment you buy
it and the expiration date. So the math works like this. Let's say the stock goes up to $105. You could exercise your option and the person who sold it to you would be forced to give you
100 shares at $100 each. So, you've basically netted
$500 in profit, of course, minus the price you paid for the option. But if the price goes down and ends below your strike price of $100. Let's say it goes to $95, it's worthless. You would never exercise your
option because you would never pay a hundred dollars for
something valued at $95. So you've lost all the money
you paid for the option in the first place. - With options, it's almost like stocks is checkers and options is chess. - So to recap, if you're buying a call betting that the stock price will go up, you can make money if
the stock price goes up beyond a certain amount. If it goes down, you lose everything you
paid for the option. And a funny side note,
Sebastian is actually a gamer and a leader of a nerdy game group. - I kind of have mixed
reviews about this place but I guess if you needed
to pick something up same day in a hurry, it would do. - So he knew GameStop was worth much less but that didn't stop him from investing. - This is GameStop stock. It's trading at $330. When I checked the Wall Street bets forum and people are talking about buying in and holding it to go to the moon. If that's not the moon,
I don't know what it is. - $330 a share. That's more than 33 times
what it had been trading a month earlier. According to polling, as many
as a quarter of Americans bought these meme stocks in January. Stocks that were being
heavily promoted on forums, where app trading was popular - During the game stock pandemonium, there are times when the
live ticker kind of froze and even the trade button to
buy or sell it was unavailable. And that's when I knew things were really getting out of control
when they couldn't even handle basic transactions. - So many new investors had
entered the market at this time that brokers just had trouble keeping up with all the orders. And that's what happened to me at the beginning of this video. I put in a market order
when the cost was low but because the platform froze, the trade didn't go through immediately. It was filled much later when the price had more than tripled. So, I was thinking I was buying one thing when I was on the hook
for more than $10,000. So it seems a few things
were going on here. First, Robinhood and others
decided to halt trading of the most popular stocks in America. The sites just couldn't handle the load of all of these users, which is known as- - Operational resiliency is what they call the abilities of the platforms to function under times of extreme stress and all of the investment
platforms this year have really struggled to
maintain their functionality. All these brokerage
platforms have essentially been built since the financial crisis. 10 years ago, you couldn't buy stocks and shares on your phone. - It was like staring at
a screen full of numbers, looked like a giant Excel spreadsheet. It could be very intimidating. The accessibility has
really just exploded. It's become so much more
easy to understand , so much more easy to research new stocks. - All of these platforms have
had tremendous user growth in the last year. So they really are struggling to adjust to the new level of
investment participation. - And some brokers just simply didn't have
enough cash on hand to handle the amount of trades
that were happening on mass. Robinhood had to go and raise a billion dollars from investors. To wrap things up, the risks are quite high
for your average investor entering into the market. For one, stocks are highly volatile and these meme stocks, who
knows what could happen to them. These apps like Robinhood
and Webull aren't always the most reliable place to
invest your money longterm. As for my personal story, I waited a few of the most
stressful hours of my life and eventually the game
stock price did rise. So I was able to break even, but it wasn't a wise investment. I came away with a feeling like the whole system was not
meant to protect users like me because I had no control
over the situation. - By the time information
becomes widespread, everybody knows about it and you're not gonna get ahead of the herd or the institutions that have
access to this information earlier and are able to
execute trades faster. So one of the things that
surprised me the most was how many people bought shares in GameStop when it was above $400 only
to be left holding the bag when the price came back down to earth.",meme+stock+trading,"['I', 'm', 'not', 'a', 'trader', 'but', 'I', 'follow', 'a', 'subreddit', 'on', 'Reddit', 'called', 'Wall',

25,p7HKvqRI_Bo," In the 1600s the Dutch East India Company 
employed hundreds of ships to trade gold, porcelain, spices, 
and silks around the globe. But running this massive 
operation wasn’t cheap. In order to fund their expensive voyages, the company turned to private citizens– individuals who could invest money 
to support the trip in exchange for a share 
of the ship’s profits. This practice allowed the company 
to afford even grander voyages, increasing profits for both 
themselves and their savvy investors. Selling these shares in coffee houses 
and shipping ports across the continent, the Dutch East India Company unknowingly
invented the world’s first stock market. Since then, companies have been 
collecting funds from willing investors to support all kinds of businesses. And today, the stock market has schools, careers,
and even whole television channels dedicated to understanding it. But the modern stock market is 
significantly more complicated than its original incarnation. So how do companies and investors
use the market today? Let’s imagine a new coffee company 
that decides to launch on the market. First, the company will advertise itself 
to big investors. If they think the company is a good idea, they get the first crack at investing, and then sponsor the company’s initial 
public offering, or IPO. This launches the company onto the 
official public market, where any company or individual who 
believes the business could be profitable might buy a stock. Buying stocks makes those investors 
partial owners in the business. Their investment helps 
the company to grow, and as it becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential 
and start buying stocks. As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price, increasing 
the cost for prospective buyers, and raising the value of the company's 
stocks people already own. For the company, this increased interest helps 
fund new initiatives, and also boosts its overall market value by showing how many people 
are willing to invest in their idea. However, if for some reason a company 
starts to seem less profitable the reverse can also happen. If investors think their stock 
value is going to decline, they’ll sell their stocks with the hopes 
of making a profit before the company loses more value. As stocks are sold and demand 
for the stock goes down, the stock price falls, and with it, the company’s market value. This can leave investors with big losses– unless the company starts to look 
profitable again. This see-saw of supply and demand 
is influenced by many factors. Companies are under the unavoidable 
influence of market forces– such as the fluctuating 
price of materials, changes in production technology, and the shifting costs of labor. Investors may be worried about 
changes in leadership, bad publicity, or larger factors like 
new laws and trade policies. And of course, plenty of investors are simply ready 
to sell valuable stocks and pursue personal interests. All these variables cause day-to-day noise
in the market, which can make companies appear more
or less successful. And in the stock market, appearing to lose value often leads 
to losing investors, and in turn, losing actual value. Human confidence in the market has the
power to trigger everything from economic booms 
to financial crises. And this difficult-to-track 
variable is why most professionals promote 
reliable long term investing over trying to make quick cash. However, experts are constantly 
building tools in efforts to increase their 
chances of success in this highly unpredictable system. But the stock market is not just 
for the rich and powerful. With the dawn of the Internet, everyday investors can buy stocks in many of the exact same ways 
a large investor would. And as more people educate themselves 
about this complex system they too can trade stocks, support the businesses they believe in, and pursue their financial goals. The first step is getting invested.",stock+market,"['In', 'the', '1600s', 'the', 'Dutch', 'East', 'India', 'Company', 'employed', 'hundreds', 'of', 'ships', 'to', 'trade', 'gold', 'porcelain',

THANK GOD THE VACCINES ARE PLENTIFUL AND DISTRIBUTED FASTER THAN EXPECTED SO THE J&J NEWS  DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON MY OPINION. >> AHEAD OF EARNING SEASON YOU'RE WORRIED BECAUSE YOU'RE  DOWN GRADING THE MARKET VIEW.  >> IT'S A RARE VIEW, IT'S BASED  ON FOUR THINGS I THOUGHT THAT THE 60-MINUTE INTERVIEW WITH JEROME POWELL WAS PRETTY HAWKISH IT WAS A CHANGE IN TONE. SO EVERY TIME I AM ON THE SHOW I LOOK INTO THE CAMERA AND SAY THE GUYS KEEP PRINTING THE MONEY KEEP GIVING US THE GAME PLAN AND KEEP PRINTING US THE MONEY ON 60 MINUTES HE LITERALLY SAID  GROWTH WAS GOING TO BE STRONG. HE DIDN'T REALLY HEDGE IT. HE SAID MAYBE HAVING COVID-19  COME BACK COULD PUT A RISK INTO  IT BUT HE WAS VERY BULLISH IN  ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN  THAT FOLLOW THAT COUPLED WITH EARNINGS SEASON THERE'S A DUKE UNIVERSITY CFO SURVEY THAT PULLS HUNDREDS OF CFO'S IT COMES OUT ONCE A MONTH, IT IS SMALL, LARGE COMPANY, PRIVATE COMPANY, PUBLIC COMPANY, DOMESTIC, INTERNATIONAL, AND IT HIT THE  THIRD-HIGHEST LEVEL IN HISTORY SO THERE'S NOBODY ON THIS PLANET THAT IS GOING TO BE SURPRISED BY GOOD EARNINGS AND GOOD ECONOMY OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS EVEN TO THE POINT OF JEROME  POWELL SAYING THAT.  >> ARE YOU THINKING JEROME POWELL SAYING IT IS A  CONTRAIREIAN INDICATOR OR THAT HE IS STARTING TO TALK ABOUT QE  IN SOME WAY, MANAGING MARKET EXPECTATION? >> SO, MEL, WE TRY TO MAKE THIS  DIFFERENT EVERY CYCLE AND OF COURSE THE REASONS FOR THE RECESSION ARE DIFFERENT EACH CYCLE AND ALWAYS ENDS IN A CREDIT CRISIS. ONCE YOU'RE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET THE FED COMES IN TO THE RESCUE AND GAME CHANGED IT ON  APRIL 9th THEY ANNOUNCED THEY  WOULD BUY CORPORATE DEBT THEY  WAS A GAME CHANGING EVENT WE THOUGHT. THIS IS 2004 THIS IS 2010 YOU'RE ON THE BACK OF A MONSTER  MOVE YOU'VE HAD AN ACCELERATION PENDING IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT IS VERY IDENTIFIABLE, IT  FELT LIKE DURING THAT RAMP THE FED IS NEVER GOING TO SAY  ANYTHING NEGATIVE. AND OF COURSE THEY DO. IN 2004 YOU HAD AN 8% DECLINE  OVER FEW MONTHS COMING FROM A  PEAK IN APRIL. AND IN 2010 YOU HAD A PEEK IN  APRIL AND YOU HAD ABOUT A 15%  FLASH CRASH DECLINE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THOSE  IT'S GONNA BE BUT I THINK THE  COMBINATION OF THOSE FACTORS AS  I SAID BEFORE PLUS ALL OF THE  OPTIMISM AND FOUR KEY FACTIC ALLOCATORS BEING HISTORICAL  EXTREMES GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAYBE TAKE SOME PROFIT AND BE READY TO ATTACK WHEN ANY WEAKNESS COMES IN. >> HEY, TONY, IT'S JEFF MILLS, JUST A QUICK QUESTION TO PRESS THIS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER  RELATIVE TO THE FED. WE GOT IN23FLATION DATA HOTTER  THAN EXPECTED, EVERYONE'S  EXPECTING HOTTER INFLATION GIVEN YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPS TALK ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE  DATA AND HOW IT MIGHT FACTOR INTO THE FED'S POSTURE IN THE  NEXT COUPLE QUARTERS.  >> AS YOU KNOW THE FED LIKE TO USE CORE PC PERSONAL CONSUMGS  EXPENDITURE, IT HAS MORE WEIGHTING, TODAY'S NUMBER WAS A  LITTLE BIT HOTTER, THAT'S  SOMETHING WE KNEW. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE TEN-YEAR  NOTE YIELD WE'VE HAD NOTHING BUT ECONOMIC NEWS WHICH SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE MAYBE SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS AGO YOU HAD AWESOME ECONOMIC NEWS. YOU HAD A SURPRISE IN THE  INFLATION PICTURE, WAS A LITTLE  BIT EXPECTED YET THE TEN YEAR  WENT FROM 177 TO 161 AGAIN IT'S NOT THE EXACT LEVEL THAT'S IMPORTANT, IT'S THE FACT  THAT IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS EXCITEMENT THAT BROUGHT JEROME POWELL ON BOARD THAT BROUGHT THE CFO'S ON BOARD, I'M SOUNDING HE  REALLY BEARISH, ALL OF THOSE FACTORS COMBINED WITH TOO MUCH OPTIMISM CREATES A ENVIRONMENT RIGHT FOR A BROADER-BASED PULL BACK >> WE'RE JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME, TONY, I DO WANT TO CLARIFY YOU'VE BEEN KNOWN AS THE PERMEABLE IS THIS A TRADING CALL WITH THE BELIEF WE'RE STILL IN AN INTACTFUL MARKET? >> IT IS BUT IT'S MEANINGFUL I THINK WE'RE IN AN EARLY AND  NEW ECONOMIC CYCLE. IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT LONG TO  BANKS AND TANKS LAST MAY IT  SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE NOW  EVERYBODY'S IN THERE AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO REPORT GREAT EARNINGS,  AS A PAUSE THAT REFRESHES AND  CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY CAPITALIZE ON THE NEXT LEG HIGHER WHICH I THINK WILL BE IN THE SECOND HALF AND INTO 2022. >> TONY, GREAT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU >> TONY DWYER COUNTER SHALL  DIDDEDK. WHEN THE PERMEABLE PULLS IN ITS  HORNS THAT'S GOT TO GIVE YOU PAUSE. >> IT DOES I UNDERSTAND THE LAST QUESTION,  ONCE LOOKING AT THE CHART ON S&P WE GET BACK TO PRE-COVID LEVELS  YOU COULD HAVE SAID LET'S THROW  IN THE, CASH OUT, GET BEARISH, WE'RE 22% ABOVE THAT LEVEL NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT 6 TO 7%  PRINT IN G DP.

27,Ba2dJXeop8U, in the fallout of one of the most volatile american elections ever financial markets did something very strange they rose and rose to new record levels again this would be unusual during even a normal election where most investors tend to sit back and wait for the dust to settle but it is especially strange in 2020 joe biden who everybody is at least 90 confident will be the next president has spoken very openly about plans to raise corporate taxes and this is coming in conjunction with tensions around how a transition to power may or may not take place not to mention that global pandemic if investors are supposed to fear uncertainty surely they would be terrified of the current world that we live in logic would dictate that the best outcome for the major corporations that make up financial markets would have been a nice simple and decisive republican victory at the end of the day they tend to be slightly more pro-business instead what they got was an extremely contentious democratic victory with the potential to bring turbulence around key issues like covered relief packages in the coming months so what is going on here why have markets rallied so hard in spite of all this turbulence will this market boom reverse if the proposed policies of the biden campaign are actually rolled out and could it be that investors just no longer favored trump as president now this is becoming a bit of a common trend but big disclaimer time since this video we'll be looking at the market rally in the context of the election we need to note that we are not politically advocating for one party or another everything over there in america land looks all kinds of crazy and we do not want to get involved at all we will be here to comment on the economic fallout though this episode of economics explained is brought to you by trends if you're a hustling entrepreneur investor or are thinking about starting your own business you are absolutely going to

and in the video description below now this is actually the third time we have explored a similar market rally on the channel before but we will be looking at a completely different set of contributing factors this time around even still those other two videos are no less relevant so if you are interested in this topic go and check out those videos there as well but in brief some major contributing factors are a lot of money being pumped into the system through quantitative easing from the federal reserve creating an environment where people have a decent amount of cash this combined with record low interest rates means that people don't have anywhere to keep their cash other than in the stock market where even if they only get a four or five percent return it's better than the zero percent that they would get in a bank the other big reason we explored previously were that foreign investors were moving their money into the us market which has historically been perceived as a large stable safe house during times of economic turbulence in the world now both of these factors are still true to a certain extent but much less so now than they were earlier in the year government stimulus has slowed down massively and was ground to a halt prior to the election by the senate being dismissed this is the main channel by which that money printing done by the federal reserve gets out there into the world what's more is that america is no longer that same safe house it was for international investors the turbulence around the election as well as the swelling infection rates across the nation mean that a lot of international institutions and individuals are instead preferring to invest in their own countries which have comparatively fared a lot better the international community might also be able to pull some influence in a way that people often forget their variable buying power since the start of the pandemic the american dollar has dropped significantly compared to other world reserve currencies like the euro the yen and even the australian dollar this actually came following a huge spike in the value of us dollars during the initial crash when exchange rates are considered the s p 500 is still comparatively below its all-time high earlier in the year for example i am an australian that invests into american index funds using australian dollars and my portfolio is still comparatively worse off than it was at the beginning of the year i know boohoo for me but it also means that as i earn a salary in australian dollars i can buy more american shares with the same amount of cash driving up prices all this is to say that these two factors tend to be what everyone points to to explain away the market rally but if this really did explain everything the new market high would certainly not have waited until now to show up so what else is going on earlier this week amidst all the chaos in the world pfizer announced that they had developed a vaccine with a 90 effectiveness in initial trials this was great news and gave an indication to the world that this ordeal may soon be coming to an end an end where life can go back to normal where people can go out go to work go to dinner go on holidays all things that will breathe life back into businesses that have been hanging on by a thread now this is very good news obviously and we don't want to in any way diminish this impressive achievement by pfizer and the wider medical research community but the overwhelming message from professionals in the know is not to get overly excited about this news just yet medicine is a legendarily bureaucratic business any new product has to jump through an endless array of hoops before it is released to the general public especially when it's a vaccine which has an even higher set of standards of testing because it is given to healthy people rather than to people that are already sick now given the potential benefits pfizer is in talks with the fda to fast track this process cutting it down from something that would have normally taken years to something that could be rolled out within a few months but for this to be approved there can be absolutely no signs of any complications even still sometimes just the glimmer of hope is enough for investors to think that other investors are going to get into the market and so they get into the market to try and beat out those other investors and so on and so forth until the type of reaction you would expect from good news is achieved even if the good news wasn't that great this is one of the key cognitive biases that is taught to most professional investors working for large institutions the bandwagon bias means that people will look at the money they stand to make jump in safe in the comfort that there will be some greater fool following along as for genuine long-term outlook if this breakthrough is real and remains on schedule for public distribution it would lead to a significant boost to the fundamentals of companies that have been impacted by this health crisis airlines could fly again cruise ships could cruise again and shopping malls could go back to being packed out war zones on a sunday afternoon you know like the good old days the thing is though these aren't the stocks that have been doing well during this price boom retail and transport have done well since the news broke but have been outperformed even still by technology companies now this is especially weird because technology companies haven't been too badly affected by the new world that we are living in in fact some of them have benefited greatly from online shopping home deliveries and business communication systems that have become a requirement rather than a luxury so why would these businesses be doing better than the ones that really stand again from this good news well perhaps this is a sign of a troubled road to recovery there are a lot of businesses out there which are now almost exclusively reliant on government stimulus to remain alive mostly the businesses that we were looking at earlier like retail airlines and cruise lines given the turbulence surrounding the election it is likely that any talks of continued stimulus are going to be pushed to the side in favor of arguing about the nuances of a broken election system this means that these companies may very well fall into bankruptcy during this drawn-out process and even though the promise of a world back to normal may only be a few months away it's no good to them when they are going into receivership now tech stocks by contrast are doing well now and will probably be doing better in a normal world with higher employment this makes them a safer bet for future prosperity bill ackman a hedge fund manager who profited over 2.6 billion dollars from a single trade that predicted the first market downturn has announced earlier this week in an interview with the financial times that he has taken out similar positions again to bridge the credit gap of unstable businesses over the next 12 months there is no point betting on what the biggest recovery winner will be if you aren't sure who is going to make it to that recovery phase but for those who do there is one other piece of good news that came out earlier last week a landscape of gridlocked stability investors love one thing above all else and that is certainty investors would rather know that the world is going to be hit by a giant asteroid for certain because they could invest in bunkers and canned food companies as opposed to only having a 50 chance of being hit by an asteroid because if the predictions don't come true then those bunkers and canned food reserves are not going to perform well on their portfolio we saw a slightly less extreme version of this effect earlier in the year when people were unsure about how bad the fallout of the chronovirus would get they wanted to pull their money out of the market until they could pick and choose where and when to put it back in as soon as the world realized that oh yeah this is bad people begrudgingly reinvested just with the outlook of backing companies that would be able to weather the storm now the future can never be 100 certain but when the outcomes of big changes in the world are completely up in the air most investors like to sit back and see how things play out before funneling all of their money into something even if that means that they might miss out on huge speculative gains remember this is investing not gambling although the line does sometimes get a bit blurred even still you might say well that kind of uncertainty still exists and well yeah that's true but the election gave investors a much bigger gift than you might expect a mixed government regardless of who is sitting in the oval office on the 21st of january and again i'm not getting into it you'll be crazy it doesn't really matter because neither party will control the house and the senate and the presidency this means that any laws or budgets that they want to get past will either be rejected by one step of this process or will need to be watered down to get the tick of approval from both parties we went into a lot more detail as to how this works on our trump verse biden video so go and watch that if you're interested in bureaucratic government processes now while this outcome might be less than ideal for the political parties it's great for investors biden's proposed tax plans will likely not make it through the republican-controlled senate without a lot of changes likewise any plans to cut welfare spending or lower taxes further will not get through the democratic controlled house so it pushes government policy changes into a bit of a stalemate which is fantastic for investors for a few reasons the companies they are investing in can work on the rules that exist in the world now and don't have to be ready to shift strategy at a moment's notice due to some major change in policy it also means that investors can project growth over a longer term rather than trading on back and forth policy changes there is a semi-humorous expression in institutional investing don't change anything ever at economics explained we might call it stability and confidence but whatever you brand it there is one way to make sure that nothing changes ever and that's to try and get politicians to work on something together [Applause] all jokes aside this is a signal that investors may be getting the best of both worlds overall donald trump's impacts on the financial market have been overwhelmingly positive driven heavily by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 markets have grown steadily over his term as president only really faltering twice once was the christmas crash of 2018 which was a very short but severe downturn which was eventually alleviated by strong consumer spending figures and then the second wave was of course the market's reaction to the pandemic in early 2020 having a pro-business government has surprise surprise been good for business but it hasn't been perfect trade tensions have been a major concern for a lot of multinationals in recent years businesses have been hesitant to fine-tune supply chains especially involving mexico and china out of fear that they will be hit with tariffs or be forced to reinvest into alternatives now while fiscal policy involves the cooperation of the legislative and executive branch of government the president has a lot more direct control over trade through the department of commerce as well as having face time with other world leaders one of joe biden's big contributions to the obama administration was shaping foreign policy through trade and throughout his campaign he has maintained positive rhetoric around building these mutually beneficial connections if businesses could be handed a future where they got to keep the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 while having certainty around global supply chains and trade agreements they would be very happy little jelly beans indeed and with the current mixed government it looks like that might be exactly what they're about to get the idea that the markets are happy to see trump go is pretty silly remember four years ago his election drove a market rally for exactly the same reasons that we have explored many times on this channel but as heartless as it sounds it might just be that his usefulness has run its course big businesses have gone tax cuts you beauty we will take that huge private sector stimulus don't mind if we do and now they are ready for the dessert which is healthy international trade in a world that might soon be back to normal the market can remain irrational longer than rational investors can remain solvent and who knows by the time this video is made public the market could have dropped 10 or shot up by 10 it really is anybody's guess at this point there are so many technical factors mixed with human emotions that go into pricing a stock that it really is hard to explain from time to time but even still it is a great gauge on people's confidence in the world people often joke that the stock market is just a chart of rich people's emotions and as funny as that may sound it's absolutely true so if there's any takeaway from these new record highs it's that something is going on that makes wealthy people happy in the meantime average americans and citizens around the world can only hope that this is something that will make them happy as well now understanding what it is that makes these influential people tick can be a difficult process one that can be made a lot easier with trends with a subscription to trends you'll not

28,ocYsM2KHhP8, when you watch or listen to the news have you noticed that there are a few topics that always get covered weather sports unfortunately politics and news about the stock market while it may be easy to understand the weather or sports segments stock market news can feel like a secret code you know some people make a lot of money somehow but how if the stock market confuses you you're not alone according to the global 2014 survey two-thirds of adults are not financially literate it's not your fault schools don't teach this stuff but the good news is you can understand the basics quite easily first what even is stock imagine taking a company and breaking it into a lot of tiny pieces a stock is one of those small pieces or a share of a company and when we say a lot of tiny pieces we mean a lot amazon for instance is made up of over 500 million shares when you buy a stock you're buying one or more of those pieces of a company for the most part you can only buy shares of public companies a public company is one whose shares are available on a public market called a stock market while many large national companies are public not all of them are in fact of the approximately 600 000 u.s companies with at least 20 employees less than one percent are public for example say you really like candy and want to live out your willy wonka fantasies by owning a piece of a candy company if you want to buy shares of mars the company behind m m's snickers and skittles too bad it's a private company so you can't buy any shares of it instead you might have to settle for hershey's which is a public company and so offers its shares in the stock market now that we know what a stock is let's go back to the news when you hear the stock market went up that means that overall the price for pieces of public companies increase this doesn't mean every company share went up just that across the whole stock market people generally paid more for pieces for a company today than they did yesterday but when you hear the opposite the stock market went down that means that on a whole the traders paying less for stocks today than they were yesterday you may hear things like the dow was up today or the s p was down today but what does that mean the dow and the s p also known as the s p 500 are bundles of stock that are actually considered to be representative of the stock market as a whole think of it as an appetizer sampler platter with some pieces a lot of different things the dow is a collection of 30 different companies while the s p 500 reflects the shares of 500 different companies while people often use the dow or the s p 500 as stand-ins for how the stock market is doing it is important to realize the stock market is not a stand-in for how the economy is doing this may be counterintuitive since many of us associate the economy with the stock market but they are different things the economy is a big and complex system so big so complex that it's actually hard to even define encompasses different metrics like the employment rate the prices of goods and services taxes and a myriad of other factors all interrelated and affecting one another because the economy as a whole is so big and complex but the stock market is relatively easy to understand the dow goes up dow goes down many people use a stock market as a substitute in their minds for the economy as a whole think of the entire economy like a football stadium the stock market is like the scoreboard it tells you a lot of useful information about what's going on inside the football stadium the score players stats the number of people in attendance but you never say the entire football stadium is the scoreboard it may be important part of it but there's so much more to the economy than the stock market in fact there are times when the stock market and the economy can become disconnected for instance during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic the stock market is reaching new highs millions of americans however are expecting financial disaster how can that be the answer is in the fact that a booming stock market only directly benefits those who own stock according to the new york times 84 of stock owned by americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households that means when the stock market's doing well those at the top benefit the most according to one of the most influential economists of the 20th century milton freeman a ceo is an employee of the owners of the company i.e the shareholders this means her only responsibility is to maximize profit since profit is revenue minus cost her job is literally to keep costs down a major cost for many companies is salaries and benefits for its workers if a company were to announce raises for all their employees it would certainly benefit the finances of those employees however it would make the cost of doing business to go up so according to friedman in order to do her job and increase stock prices a ceo would look to keep employees compensation down so even if you work for a company whose stock prices is going up it doesn't necessarily mean your economic fortunes are improving so how do average people like us get stocks and how do you make sure you make money and don't lose money there's no shortage of companies or apps that will allow you to buy or sell stocks together called trading do some research before picking one as many may have fees that outweigh any money you expect to gain by trading once you set up a stock trading account called a brokerage account a trading a stock is actually pretty easy a simple stock trade can be broken down into three steps buy one or more shares at the price the market is selling them two wait some amount of time it could be minutes days months years or even decades during this time the price of the stock will change for all kinds of reasons that people spend their entire lives trying to understand three sell those shares at the price the market is buying them that's it there are more complicated ways of investing into the stock market but this process is a basic one buy something wait until the price change and then sell it you want the price to go up after you buy something but it might go down to make money hopefully you can follow the conventional wisdom of buy low sell high you might be wondering how do i know if the value of a stock is going up or down unfortunately you don't that's sort of the whole point of the stock market when you buy a stock you're essentially making a bet that over time the stock will become more valuable than it was when you bought it prices however can go down meaning you might find yourself selling your shares for less than you paid for them that's how you lose money since no one knows a future in general it's pretty foolish to think that you can time the stock market whenever you hear someone with flashy stock market tips or no lose trading strategies they're almost certainly lying and trying to sell you something no one knows how to make guaranteed money in the stock market if they did they would keep the secret to themselves and spend all their time making money that way it's similar to when you see scam exercise products advertised that promise easy results it's just for suckers the tried and true way to make money in the stock market is slow boring investing so you have money when you're older buy some stocks and don't sell them again for ages even if the market goes down even if the market soars a good way to do this is with retirement products such as iras and 401ks over the long run the stock market has trended upwards which is why a steady unexciting investment plan is usually the best one again like exercising products if you want to get healthier the tried and true way is consistent diet and exercise not the quick gimmicks to wrap things up while the basics of the stock market are easy to understand buy wait sell before you do any investing it's important to do much more research than this video provided talk to qualified financial planners people who you trust to be looking out for your financial well-being and not trying to make a quick buck there's no rush the stock market isn't going anywhere and neither are the news segments reporting on it hopefully however now you understand a bit more of what those stories mean

29,z09OB9pxTWA, [Music] one of the tricky things about asset bubbles is that they cannot be conclusively identified while they still exist only once a bubble has popped can we be sure that it was ever there at all there are however two necessary if not sufficient conditions for the existence of a bubble the first is an accelerating increase in prices that forces valuations near historical highs the second is increasingly speculative and insane behavior among investors in the u.s stock market we clearly have that first box ticked here is the nasdaq index which is heavily weighted towards technology the sector where valuations have been the frothiest it has risen 40 this year despite the small matter of a global pandemic and an accompanying weak economy crazy behavior there's plenty of that going around too perhaps the ripest example of investor insanity is a barely profitable electric car company that has seen its share price octuple this year here is a chart of tesla shares there was a two-day period a couple of weeks ago in which tesla added the entire market value of the ford motor company twice over or how about the rocketing price of an asset that depending who you talk to may have no underlying value at all the cryptocurrency bitcoin now the argument that there is not a bubble in the american stock market is that stocks have to be so expensive because government bond yields are so low that is to say while stock prices are high the premium that investors receive for owning stocks as opposed to bonds is actually at the low end of the historical range here is a chart of the 10-year inflation-adjusted or real yield the great investor jeremy grantham says that justifying the high prices of stocks by pointing to historically low bond yields is nothing more than justifying one asset bubble by reference to another he may have a point but the fact remains that the federal reserve can keep bond yields low simply by buying more and more treasuries that is unless inflation spikes and the situation gets out of the fed's control the question of whether we have an asset bubble in the u.s stock market is nothing more or less than the question of whether we have been too complacent about the possibility of inflation if you own stocks keep a close eye on the prices of everything else [Music],stock+market,"['Music', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'tricky', 'things',

EVEN IN THE BOND MARKET. SO IT'S JUST LET IT FLY STILL. >> THE BACKDROP IS AS YOU JUST LAID OUT, MONEY HAS BEEN CHEAP FOR A LONG TIME. YIELDS HAVE COME DOWN. THE JITTERS IN THE MARKET THAT WE HAD BECAUSE YIELDS WERE RISING SO QUICKLY IN A SURPRISING FASHION HAVE  SUBSIDED SO THAT SETS US UP FOR A LITTLE  BIT MORE SUCCESS THE CHARTS THAT MIKE ILLUSTRATED SHOW THIS AS WELL. WE HAVE SO MANY NEW HIGHS. EVERY TIME WE GET THIS EXTENDED, THERE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF A PULLBACK A LITTLE BIT OF A PULLBACK IS  NOT NECESSARILY A KA NAIR YEA IN THE COAL MINE FOR THIS HUGE BEAR MARKET I WOULDN'T WANT IT TO CAUSE AN OVERREACTION I DO THINK WE'RE GOING TO  CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH A PERIOD  OF ROLLING CORRECTIONS BUT THAT'S OKAY. AND ULTIMATELY, AT THE END OF  THE YEAR, WE'RE HIGHER THAN WE ARE TODAY. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE SMOOTH THOUGH. >> COULD YOU EVER SEE A POLICY MISTAKE THROWING A WRENCH IN THE WORKS IF WE WERE TO GO TO 28%? OR IF WE WERE TO, YOU KNOW,  WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY. I DMOENT WHERE THAT COMES HOME TO ROOST I DON'T KNOW BUT IS THERE A BREAKING POINT  FOR WHETHER IT'S FED POLICY OR FISCAL POLICY OR TAX POLICY? IS THERE A POINT WHERE THAT SORT OF POISONS THE WELL, DO YOU  THINK? >> I WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE THAT  POLICYMAKERS ARE PERFECT AND DON'T MAKE MISTAKES, I THINK HISTORY SHOWS US THAT IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. IT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN. I DO THINK THE MARKET IS MORE  SENSITIVE TO FED POLICY THAN FISCAL POLICY AS FAR AS TAXES GO RIGHT NOW. AND THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT GETS SIGNALLED THAT SPOOKS MARKETS. BUT EVERYTHING THAT WE HEARD JEROME POWELL SAY IS THAT'S  PROBABLY NOT THE CASE, AT LEAST  NOT IN 2021. SO I THINK THAT FED POLICY STAYS PRETTY STEADY. THE FED CAN AND WILL WAIT TO RAISE RATES. I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THE MARKET ENJOYS  THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. THE REAL QUESTION MARK IS IF THE MARKET STARTS TO CHALLENGE THE FEDS, SO IF THAT TEN YEAR YIELD  STARTS TO CREEP BACK UP, WHICH I THINK IT WILL, IF IT STARTS TO CREEP UP TO A POINT THAT MAKES THE NED NERVOUS, HOW DO THEY RESPOND TO THAT? VERBAL SFLI DO THEY DO SOMETHING AS FAR AS YIELD CURVE CONTROL? THEN THE MARKET HAS TO DIGEST  THAT I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING TO WATCH. >> AMAZING, MIKE DO YOU BUY THAT? THAT ONE GUY, J. POWELL IS MORE  IMPORTANT THAN HOW MANY  POLITICIANS WE GOT 550 OR SOMETHINGING? 500 PLUS PRESIDENT, ALL THE  PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN, THE CABINET, ONE GUY NO WONDER THEY CALL HIM THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD. >> ONE GUY AND THE CONSENSUS OF  ALL THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO, I THINK THAT MOSTLY  BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL  INCREMENTAL TWEAK TO POLICY ON THE FED RIGHT NOW THAT WE CAN  FORESEE MIGHT BE MORE IMPACTFUL  THAN WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW. THE FISCAL SITUATION IS  BASICALLY BAKED. YEAH, WE MIGHT GET INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S NOT -- NEXT YEAR WE'LL TALK ABOUT FISCAL DRAG BECAUSE WE'RE  NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING LIKE  THE EXTRA SYSTEM LAUS PACKAGES WE GOT THIS YEAR I DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS ON FED POLICY. I DON'T THINK THAT HIS NERVE IS  GOING TO NECESSARILY BREAK, J. POWELLS. THE MARKET HAS THIS PUSH-PULL  SITUATION. WHEN THEY SEE THE ECONOMY  HEATING UP, HE CAN'T STICK IT  TO WE GOT PEOPLE PRICING IN RATE  HIKES FOR 2022 OR 2023 THAT NOW  STARTED TO GET PRICED OUT. THE MARKET ITSELF IS GOING TO  TALK ITSELF INTO AND OUT OF  ANXIETY ABOUT THAT PICTURE MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE, IN FACT,  HE CHANGES POLICY, I WOULD IMAGINE. >> LIZ, DID YOU TAKE COVID-19? I DON'T THINK EITHER MIKE OR YOU SAID COVID-19. IN THE LAST FOUR MINUTES IS THAT JUST IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR CAN WE SAFELY SAY THAT >> NO. I DON'T THINK WE CAN SAFELY SAY  THAT I DON'T THINK COVID-19 IS  COMPLETELY IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR BUT WHEN WE LOOK FORWARD, I  STILL THINK THAT THE FUTURE IS BRIGHTER THAN THE PRESENT. AND THERE ARE HIGH IMPACT LOW  PROBABILITY EVENTS THAT COULD  COME UP. THINGS LIKE STRAIN THAT'S WE CAN'T CONTROL. WE GO BACKWARDS IN THE SHUTDOWNS. BUT I THINK THOSE BECOME LOWER AND LOWER PROBLEMABILITY AS WE O FORWARD. YOU CAN'T INVEST ON ALL OF THOSE HIGH IMPACT, LOW PROBABILITY EVENTS BECAUSE THEN YOU MISS OUT ON THE HIGH MORE PROBABILITY EVENTS WHICH ARE THAT THE MARKET CAN CONTINUE TO MA",stock+market,"['CAMEL',

31,61BXy9R1ZJA," FOR THE MOST WE SHOULD NOTE THE  RUSSELL IS DOWN 1.3% LET'S GET TO THE COMMITTEE JOSH, IT LOOKS LIKE CONTINUATION OF THIS TREND, A QUESTIONING OF  VALUE AS WELL AS SMALL CAPS AT THIS POINT 9. >> YEAH, I GUESS I JUST, MELISSA -- SO GOOD TO BE ON WITH YOU, BY THE WAY. I GUESS I JUST DON'T LOOK AT IT  AS GROWTH VERSUS VALUE I LOOK AT IT AS REOPENING VERSUS NOT. I REALLY FEEL THAT LARGE POOLS OF CAPITAL ARE INVESTING THEMATICALLY MORE SO THAN  INVESTING ON STYLE YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE GROWTH  INVESTORS, VALUE INVESTORS AND THEN GENERALISTS AND MOST OF THE MONEY IN THE MARKET IS THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR, THINKING ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND THINKING ABOUT REOPENING. I THINK THOSE ARE THE KEY  DIVISION LINES IN THE MARKET TODAY, MORE SO THAN GROWTH VERSUS VALUE I WANT TO SPOTLIGHT BERKSHIRE  HATHAWAY, BRKB, I'M LONG I THINK THIS IS A BERKSHIRE  HATHAWAY KIND OF MARKET RIGHT  NOW. RUSSELL 2000 GROWTH DOWN ANOTHER 3%, BUT WHAT CONTINUES TO BE STRONG ARE THE AREAS THAT  BERKSHIRE TENDS TO INVEST IN YOU HAVE U.S. STEEL UP, WHICH  TAKES AN ACT OF GOD GENERALLY, FOR THAT STOCK TO RALLY. THAT'S TICKER SYMBOL X LOOK AT THE RAILS WITH A MARGE MERGER WITH KSU. THE HOME BUILDERS ARE ABSOLUTELY ON FIRE. AND THE BANKS ARE NOT GIVEN MUCH BACK, BY AND LARGE, INSURANCE  COMPANIES, EITHER. THIS IS A BERKSHIRE TYPE OF  MARKET I WOULD POINT OUT THE BREAKOUT IN BERKSHIRE THAT HAPPENED MARCH 9th, RETESTED ON LIGHT VOLUME, RIGHT BACK TO -- HEADED TOWARD NEW RECORD HIGHS THAT BREAKOUT IS A MONSTER IT IS YEARS IN THE MAKING, SO IF YOU'RE LONG THAT NAME WITH ME, I WOULD STICK WITH IT. >> I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION THAT JOSH IS MAKING, IN TERMS OF HOW YOU VIEW THE SECTORS AT THIS POINT OF TIME  WITHIN THIS RIVER, SHANNON SOME SOME VALUE MAY BE CONSIDERED JUST OVERPRICED, IF NOT VALUE IN THE TYPICAL SENSE,  BUT REFLATION AND REOPENING  SEEMS TO BE A BETTER CATEGORIZESATION THAT SO MANY  THING ARE THE ONES TO BE IN  RIGHT NOW. >> I WOULD AGREE WITH JOSH I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VALUE AND GROWTH AND CYCLICALS, WANTING TO ADD  INCREMENTAL EXPOSURE TO CYCLICAL NAMES. WE HAVE A BARBIOME APPROACH. WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY PLAY IN  THE HIGH-GROWTH NAMES OF LAST  YEAR, AND WE'RE NOT REACHING INTO THE DEEP, DEEP VALUE  CYCLICALS THAT WE HAVE SEEN  REALLY RALLY THIS FIRST THREE  MONTHS OF THE YEAR WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS THINKING ABOUT THIS ECONOMIC REBOUND BEING SUSTAINABLE, BEING CONSISTENT FOR THE NEXT TWO  YEARS, BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE MANUFACTURE ASPECT OF THE  REBOUND. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF  EMPHASIS PLACED ON THE REOPENING OF THE CONSUMER, WHERE WE  ALREADY HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE MANUFACTURING REBOUND IS HERE TO SAY. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR  PORTFOLIO AND THINKING OF IT IN  TERMS OF HOW DO I PLAY THIS  POTENTIAL VOLATILITY WE MIGHT  SEE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT  FEW MONTHS I THINK YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING  THE LONG GAME FOR THE NEXT 14, 18 MONTHS. THERE'S OTHER PARTS OF REOPENING, LIKE IN HEALTHCARE, THAT CAN BE PLAYED EASY SLIT,  BUD DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF ON AN ALL-CYCLICAL PORTFOLIO THERE'S STILL A LOT OF GOOD  NAMES THAT MIGHT BE CLASSIFIED AS GROWTH OR QUALITY THAT COULD  POTENTIAL RALLY AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE NEXT 12 TO 18 MONTHS AS WELL. >> STEVE WEISS, AN INTERESTING POINT BY MIKE WILSON AT MORGAN STANLEY, THE THING THAT WORRIES  HIM THE MOST IN THE NEXT 6 TO 12 MONTHS, IS THE ABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND DEMAND IS GOING TO BE SO STRONG  COMINGOUT OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT, YOU KNOW, SERVICES,  MANUFACTURED GOODS, ALL OF THAT  MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP THAT COULD BE A HICCUP IN THE  RECOVERY DO YOU SEE THAT? SHANNON WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER DEMAND AND  MANUFACTURING. >> I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE IN ONE RESPECT, THAT THE ECONOMY WILL BE JUST BARRELING AHEAD, BUT WHAT THAT ALSO LEADS  TO IS INFLATION. INFLATION WILL RAMP UP, IF MIKE'S RIGHT, QUICKEN THAN ANYBODY IS ANTICIPATING. REALISTICALLY, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ISSUE I'M WITH SHANNON, AND I'VE BEEN  SAYING IT FOR A WHILE, IS THAT THE MANUFACTURING BOOM IS GOING  TO REALLY BOOM OUT OF CONTROL, IN A GOOD WAY. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT CAP EX SPENDING THE LAST TWO YEARS, IT  WAS FALLING OVER MEANFULLY,  BECAUSE CEOs DIDN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHICH DIRECTION  THE COMPANY WAS GOING TO GO. WITH ALL OF THAT CASH ON THE SIDELINES, WITH BUYBACKS, WE'RE  CONTINUING TO SEE NEGATIVELY COME OFF WASHINGTON, SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? INVEST IN YOUR BUSINESS? YOUR JOBS? BUT TO THE EARLIER QUESTION, THE QUESTION THAT JOSH WAS DISCUSSION, LIKE, I'VE SAID IT NOT ONLY NOW, BUT LAST YEAR, THE YEAR BEFORE, I DON'T REALLY LOOK AT MARKETS WHEN I PICK STOCKS. I ALWAYS LOOK BOTTOMS UP,  BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE  GOING TO FIND THE VALUE. THE VALUE IS NOT IN CAT AND  DEERE. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VALUE. VALUE IS IN SOME OTHER NAMES THAT'S HOW I'M PLAYING THIS. THAT'S HOW I'M GOING FLOORED AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT. I THINK THIS IS A PARTICULARLY ROUGH WEEK WHO'S GOING TO GO INTO THE WEEKEND WITH THE MARKETS CLOSED  ON FRIDAY AND THE PAYROLLS NUMBER COMING OUT ON FRIDAY. I THINK ALTHOUGH GET A STRONG  NUMBER WITH JOBS REOPENS WE SEE TODAY THE MARKET WAS  STARTING OUT OKAY, NOT GREAT,  BUT THEN RATES MOVED UP  AGGRESSIVELY, SO NOW YOU HAVE  THE MARKET SELLING OFF THEN YOU HAVE BIDEN'S  INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DISCOUNTING  THE MARKET DOES THAT MEAN HIGHER RATES? OR WILL THEY FOCUS ON THE  ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT AND BUY THE MARKET, YES, THE -- SO IT'S A  PRETTY CONFUSING TIME IN THEET MY",stock+market,"['FOR', 'THE', 'MOST', 'WE', 'SHOULD', 'NOTE', 'THE',

32,EIFtc0DWKxU, what is the stock market presented by Wall Street survivor calm this is Jimmy Jimmy is from Miami Jimmy is a baseball fan it has a huge baseball card collection Jimmy the smart boy that he is realizes that his card collection is very valuable especially since his Derek Jeter card has skyrocketed value Jimmy wants to sell his cards to buy a new skateboard Jimmy figures his best bet is to set up shop at the local flea market which is a place where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods buyers try to negotiate with sellers to get the best possible price but often buyers and sellers meet somewhere in the middle Mike a huge sports fan spots the Jeter card and asked Little Jimmy what the price is Jimmy responds that is 100 dollars and mike says it e will give him 80 Jimmy suggests they meet in the middle and settle on $90 Mike agrees and the transaction happens with both parties satisfied a flea market is a lot like the stock market but instead of people selling products like baseball cards and pottery the stock market allows owners to sell their shares of companies for cash the price of the shares depends on supply and demand how many people want to buy that stock versus how many people want to sell it often just like in the flea market buyers and sellers meet in the middle say for example you own 100 shares of Apple it is trading at $300 and you're willing to sell it from 3:05 you call up your stock broker and tell him to place the order the broker won't sell the shares until a buyer is willing to meet the asking price of 305 dollars he calls his contact who worked something that has direct trading floor in New York City every company on the Nasdaq has a stand where they are selling the shares of their stocks buyers come to the stand and post their bid which is the price they are willing to pay if there are no buyers at that price the seller can drop the price or the buyer can increase their bid the stock market is made up of transactions like these which happen millions of times a day in thousands of publicly traded companies today most of these transactions happen electronically but the concept is still the same just like Mike bought the Derek Jeter card from Jimmy at the flea market you can buy stocks from the traded companies on the stock market are you interested in buying stocks you can learn how risk free on

33,WA3Jhvm4W9k," You've likely heard news reporters say things
like, The Dow is up 100 points, or The S&P is down five points. But what does that mean? The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq are examples
of stock market indices. A stock market index measures the performance
of a collection of stocks. By measuring these stocks collectively, indices
track how the overall market is performing better than only looking at the performance
of a single stock. Think of it this way: if you focus too closely
on just one thing, you might not have a good understanding of the larger picture. This is why an index's performance provides
more complete information than the performance of individual stocks--indices provide a wider
view of the stock market as a whole. The first index was the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, published in 1896. Financial reporter Charles Dow added up the
closing prices of 12 of the largest stocks at the time and divided the total by 12 to
get the average. Today, the Dow consists of 30 of the largest
and most successful companies in the U.S. These companies are handpicked by experts
to represent a wide variety of industries. Some of these companies affect the average
more than others, though, because many indices are weighted. Think of the idea of weighting like grades:
a final exam is going to make up a larger portion of your grade than a daily homework
assignment. In the Dow, companies with higher prices are
given more weight. In 2018, Boeing, the highest priced stock
in the index, made up about 9% of the index whereas Pfizer, the least expensive stock,
was only 1% of the index. So a change in Boeing's price would have
had a greater impact on the Dow than if Pfizer's price changed. While the Dow is the oldest and most well-known
index, some believe that its measurement is less representative of the overall market
than the S&P 500 even though they often perform similarly to each other. The S&P 500 measures the performance of 500
of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. Due to its broader exposure, some
believe that the S&P 500 is the best measurement of the U.S. stock market. The S&P 500 is weighted by market cap. Market cap is the number of a company's
outstanding shares multiplied by the price per share. Because of this, the companies with the largest
total market value have the greatest impact on the average of the S&P 500. The Nasdaq Composite, also referred to as
the Nasdaq, includes 3,000 or so companies that are traded on the Nasdaq exchange. The Nasdaq includes more smaller companies
than the other indices, but also includes many of the largest tech companies, like Apple,
Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Because nearly half of the companies are tech
companies, the Nasdaq is widely considered a better gauge for the Technology industry. Some of these companies may also be included
on the Dow, the S&P 500, or both. Each index helps measure how the overall market
is doing through the performance of the securities it tracks. Though the market may vary day to day, or
even year to year, the historical performances of indices show that over time, the stock
market tends to rise.",nasdaq,"['You', 've', 'likely', 'heard', 'news', 'reporters', 'say', 'things', 'like', 'The', 'Dow', 'is', 'up', '100', 'points', 'or', 'The', 'S', 'P', 'is', 'down', 'five', 'points', 'But', 'what', 'does', 'that', 'mean', 'The', 'Dow', 'S', 'P', '500', 'and', 'Nasdaq', 'are', 'examples', 'of', 'stock', 'market', 'indices', 'A', 'stock', 'market', 'index', 'measures', 'the', 'performance', 'of', 'a', 'collection', 'of', 'stocks', 'By', 'measuring', 'these', 'stocks', 'collectively', 'indices', 'track', 'how', 'the', 'overall', 'market', 'is', 'performing', 'better', 'than', 'only', 'looking', 'at', 'the', 'performance', 'of', 'a', 'single', 'stock', 'Think', 'of', 'it', 'this', 'way', 'if', 'you', 'focus', 'too', 'closely', 'on', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'you', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'a', 'good', 'understanding', 'of', 'the', 'larger', 'picture', 'This', 'is', 'why', 'an', 'index', 's', 'performance', 'provides', 'more', 'complete', 'information', 'than', 'the', 'performance', 'of', 'individual', 'stocks', 'indices', 'provide', 'a', 'wider', 'view', 'of', 'the', 'stock', 'market', 'as', 'a', 'whole', 'The', 'first', 'index', 'was', 'the', 'Dow', 'Jones', 'Industrial', 'Average', 'published', 'in', '1896', 'Financial', 'reporter', 'Charles', 'Dow', 'added', 'up', 'the', 'closing', 'prices', 'of', '12', 'of', 'the', 'largest', 'stocks', 'at', 'the', 'time', 'and', 'divided', 'the', 'total', 'by', '12', 'to', 'get', 'the', 'average', 'Today', 'the', 'Dow', 'consists', 'of', '30', 'of', 'the', 'largest', 'and', 'most', 'successful', 'companies', 'in', 'the', 'U', 'S', 'These', 'companies', 'are', 'handpicked', 'by', 'experts', 'to', 'represent', 'a', 'wide', 'variety', 'of', 'industries', 'Some', 'of', 'these', 'companies', 'affect', 'the', 'average', 'more', 'than', 'others', 'though', 'because', 'many', 'indices', 'are', 'weighted', 'Think', 'of', 'the', 'idea', 'of', 'weighting', 'like', 'grades', 'a', 'final', 'exam', 'is', 'going', 'to', 'make', 'up', 'a', 'larger', 'portion', 'of', 'your', 'grade', 'than', 'a', 'daily', 'homework', 'assignment', 'In', 'the', 'Dow', 'companies', 'with', 'higher', 'prices', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'weight', 'In', '2018', 'Boeing', 'the', 'highest', 'priced', 'stock', 'in', 'the', 'index', 'made', 'up', 'about', '9', 'of', 'the', 'index', 'whereas', 'Pfizer', 'the', 'least', 'expensive', 'stock', 'was', 'only', '1', 'of', 'the', 'index', 'So', 'a', 'change', 'in', 'Boeing', 's', 'price', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'a', 'greater', 'impact', 'on', 'the', 'Dow', 'than', 'if', 'Pfizer', 's', 'price', 'changed', 'While', 'the', 'Dow', 'is', 'the', 'oldest', 'and', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'index', 'some', 'believe', 'that', 'its', 'measurement', 'is', 'less', 'representative', 'of', 'the', 'overall', 'market', 'than', 'the', 'S', 'P', '500', 'even', 'though', 'they', 'often', 'perform', 'similarly', 'to', 'each', 'other', 'The', 'S', 'P', '500', 'measures', 'the', 'performance', 'of', '500', 'of', 'the', 'largest', 'publicly', 'traded', 'companies', 'in', 'the', 'U', 'S', 'Due', 'to', 'its', 'broader', 'exposure', 'some', 'believe', 'that', 'the', 'S', 'P', '500', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'measurement', 'of', 'the', 'U', 'S', 'stock', 'market', 'The', 'S', 'P', '500', 'is', 'weighted', 'by', 'market', 'cap', 'Market', 'cap', 'is', 'the', 'number', 'of', 'a', 'company', 's', 'outstanding', 'shares', 'multiplied', 'by', 'the', 'price', 'per', 'share', 'Because', 'of', 'this', 'the', 'companies', 'with', 'the', 'largest', 'total', 'market', 'value', 'have', 'the', 'greatest', 'impact', 'on', 'the', 'average', 'of', 'the', 'S', 'P', '500', 'The', 'Nasdaq', 'Composite', 'also', 'referred', 'to', 'as', 'the', 'Nasdaq', 'includes', '3', '000', 'or', 'so', 'companies', 'that', 'are', 'traded', 'on', 'the', 'Nasdaq', 'exchange', 'The', 'Nasdaq', 'includes', 'more', 'smaller', 'companies', 'than', 'the', 'other', 'indices', 'but', 'also', 'includes', 'many', 'of', 'the', 'largest', 'tech', 'companies', 'like', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Microsoft', 'and', 'Alphabet', 'Because', 'nearly', 'half', 'of', 'the', 'companies', 'are', 'tech', 'companies', 'the', 'Nasdaq', 'is', 'widely', 'considered', 'a', 'better', 'gauge', 'for', 'the', 'Technology', 'industry', 'Some', 'of', 'these', 'companies', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'included', 'on', 'the', 'Dow', 'the', 'S', 'P', '500', 'or', 'both', 'Each', 'index', 'helps', 'measure', 'how', 'the', 'overall', 'market', 'is', 'doing', 'through', 'the', 'performance', 'of', 'the', 'securities', 'it', 'tracks', 'Though', 'the', 'market', 'may', 'vary', 'day', 'to', 'day', 'or', 'even', 'year', 'to', 'year', 'the', 'historical', 'performances', 'of', 'indices', 'show', 'that', 'over', 'time', 'the', 'stock', 'market', 'tends', 'to', 'rise']"
34,meKTTkP-CQA," Since mid February the US Nasdaq has taken a bit 
of a nose-dive. This has shaken the confidence   amongst several retail investors. But what does 
this mean and is there really reason to worry? Since mid February the US Nasdaq has gone down, 
not necessarily by too much, but rather quite   steeply. We’ve especially seen certain individual 
stocks go down by quite a lot. Tesla -40%,   Amazon -16%, Apple -19%, Nio -50%, and so on. This 
has led to some concern amongst retail investors. But how bad is this really? What can we 
expect from this? And is this the real crash   in the making? This is exactly what 
we’ll discuss in this episode. And   as the US Nasdaq is much of a leading 
index it’ll be our target of focus. But first and as always, nothing in 
this episode is financial advice.   These are my own opinions and conclusions ONLY 
as the markets all come down to probabilities.   In this sense, just because we may 
successfully identify the most likely   outcomes, the market can still end up 
doing the unlikely and the unexpected. And if this episode helps you better understand 
the situation at hand, then please return the   favour by hitting the like and subscribe 
buttons. Let’s now dig into the technicals … So, is this it then? Well, I’m 
gonna give you one answer now   and another at the end. The first answer 
is short and you’re not gonna like it.   The answer is: No one knows. No one knows 
where the peak is until afterwards. Sure,   people might get lucky and sell at the 
very peak, but there’s no way of knowing   when the peak is in. For technical analysis 
is gaming theory and probabilities at work. However, the thing that sets good analysts apart 
from the unknowing herd is that they can identify   such reversals much earlier. And for that 
reason they can enjoy a massive advantage   compared to that of the “dumb money” as they can 
release their long positions or short the market.   For there are several clues that will 
or may materialise to any attentive   trader or technician who has done their homework 
properly. And out of all those clues, the RSI is   the most reliable one whenever it 
decides to bless us with signals. With that said, we will now look at some key   technicals that will reveal whether 
there’s reason to worry or not. And why! A big problem many technicians have, especially 
novice ones, is that they simply fail to zoom out.   For even if you’re trading the 1-hour or 4-hour 
chart, you still need to know what the prevalent   trend is. As in the primary and secular trends. 
If you don’t, then any drops on the lower time   frames may come across as if Armageddon 
and the Kraken monster had a baby together. In this sense, if we look at the 
US Nasdaq on the weekly chart I   quite frankly don’t get what the fuzz 
and panic is all about. For what’s so   worrying about this? It’s a perfectly healthy 
trend. Strong trends correct before proceeding   higher, just like crashes have their most 
temporary rays of optimism before diving   deeper. For when we break things down, what’s 
practically happened here is that the price has   re-tested its previous all-time high 
zone from above as support. That’s it.   And to add to the current 
bullishness we can see how   the price rapidly found support 
and bounced off at this zone. Don’t get me wrong. I can understand why people 
may find this move unpleasant, especially due to   the steepness thereof, for so too would I a few 
years back. But that’s why you proceed to fill   your head with valuable market behaviour knowledge 
and an essential technical understanding. For once   you do, you understand what’s happening. Then, and 
only then, can you sit back amidst the false chaos   and take a sip of your soda pop while watching 
the noobs run around with fire in their hair.   And once you understand the market and its 
behaviours it doesn’t matter whether it goes   up or down: you’ll be getting the best of 
it either way. And this is why I recommend   you to follow this channel, so that you 
too can learn how to stay in control. Let’s now filter all the chart noise and 
identify and isolate the actual signals. If we stay on the weekly Nasdaq chart we 
can make a rather significant observation.   Throughout this 12 year long bull run only one 
correction … one single correction … has taken   out a lower low that wasn’t just a new spike 
low. And that was during the Christmas of 2018.   Even the Corona bottom closed where 
the previous local bottom spiked out,   which technically qualifies for a horizontal 
support and not a lower low. And prior to that,   throughout this vast trend, we can detect 
innumerous accounts of when the price has   re-tested the previous tops as support from 
above. As just mentioned, this is not a cause   for panic – it’s a sign of health! This is exactly 
the stuff we want to see before moving higher. For   this right here is the market’s way of exhaling 
and catching its breath. What would be worrying,   on the other hand, would be if the price were 
to just to go up, up and up. That would be like   running a Marathon at full sprint capacity. You 
wouldn’t get far until your heart gives up on you.   In this sense, these moves here since the Corona 
bottom last year are utterly normal corrections. I would go as far as to say that the US Nasdaq 
can go as low as the previous local bottoms at   around 10 700 and still be perfectly healthy. 
Sure, that would scare the living hell out of   most market participants, retailers in 
particular, but that’s what the market   does! It’s in its very programming. That’s in fact 
where you should look at scaling in longs, albeit   with a tight stop-loss. There are three technical 
reasons for this. Please allow me to explain. First of all, and as we can see, any time 
throughout this 12 year-long bull run any   break below the EMA ribbons has so far amounted to 
wonderful buy opportunities where the market has   rubber-banded itself back up again. Now, 
don’t get me wrong, for at some point the   US Nasdaq will go below these ribbons and not 
recover for many years to come. But this is   where technical analysis is all about assessing 
probabilities and laying a big jigsaw puzzle.   For what has every EMA ribbon break had 
in common historically? That is apart   from one! What they have in common is that 
they haven’t taken out their previous local   bottoms. In this sense, this 2018 Christmas 
plunge was certainly a technical cause for worry.   And I would go as far as to say that it wasn’t 
back to bullish again until at this point here. Secondly, the weekly EMA50 lingers 
like a river at around 11 500 bucks.   This in itself amounts to a strong technical 
support when dealing with secular trends.   With that said, it doesn’t mean it necessarily 
needs to bounce exactly on the line. If we look at   its historical behaviour it has dived beneath this 
on multiple occasions throughout this bull trend   and each and every time it has found its way 
back up again. What this means is that there   is technical leeway. For even though there’s a 
good chance it may bounce on that line precisely,   it can move under for short periods of 
time without necessarily having breeched it   technically. Of course, any retest from 
below is always a critical moment. However,   so far it has not failed to 
do so once in twelve years. But my point here is that a test 
or temporary breach of the EMA50   won’t mean much as long as the 
safety net at 10 700 holds up. And thirdly, we have a big, nice green Ichimoku 
cloud that supports this very level. And if we   examine this entire trend the price has, just as 
with the EMA50, never managed to stay below it for   any significant time at all – all of which rather 
have amounted to strong buying opportunities.   Instead, whenever we’ve interacted with the 
green kumos, the price has nicely respected it. By that token, the 10 700 area is a strong yet 
very critical one. Any break below it would not   only plunge us below the ribbons, weekly EMA50 
and green ichimoku. They would also take out a   new local low. This could be a strong indication 
of a secular trend reversal. However, in any such   event I doubt the US Nasdaq would just throw 
itself straight down into the abyss. Instead,   I’d rather be looking at a retest at the 11 900 to 
12 300 area. And this I’d expect for two reasons.   First of all it would be a nice bounce for the 
market to lull unassuming sheep into a sense of   false security. A “the worst is over now” type of 
denial. For that’s typically how the market acts   before proceeding with the real plummet. Secondly, 
this area would constitute a strong resistance   zone for all the reasons just outlined. That area 
would then constitute a shorting area of interest. But let’s get back to the core analysis, for this 
here is getting a bit ahead of ourselves. The   reason why I bring this up at all is to let you 
into my technical reasoning as the same principles   will apply at any point from here on. For let’s 
look at it this way. If we proceed to make higher   highs, which statistically and technically 
speaking is the most likely scenario, then   we will establish new critical areas. Hence if we, 
by the same logic, were to move to 15 000 bucks,   then this area right here at 12 300 would be the 
new critical area of interest, at which any break   below it would be an indication of a possible 
secular trend reversal. Are you following? Of course, having said this, we’d ideally be given 
RSI shorting signals way in advance and way closer   to the very peak. If this were to play out then 
it would come across as nothing short of magical   to anyone who’s oblivious to these techniques. 
In any such case, they’ll be our little secret. Some technicians may raise the issue about 
the three-point RSI divergence on the weekly   that stretches back to pre-corona. And the 
three-point divergence on the monthly that   has now been broken. But as anyone knows who’s 
watched the RSI trilogy, an RSI divergence in   itself doesn’t really mean anything. They 
happen all the time! No, a divergence is   only interesting and relevant in relation to its 
technical context. From December 2013 until August   2015 we had a year and a half long RSI divergence, 
yet the price proceeded higher without much ado. On a final note, so far this trend looks perfectly 
healthy from a technical point of view. But don’t   be fooled, for fundamentally it’s all a house 
of cards that’s waiting to come crashing down. How then about that second answer that I promised 
you? The one about whether this is “it”? Well,   in that sense my answer is: No, I don’t think 
this is it. And there are two reasons for this,   one psychological and one technical. The short psychological reason is 
that markets don’t end when people   expect it to. It’s much too sadistic and conniving 
for that. Instead, it will bide its time like a   crocodile in the Nile who strikes when the prey 
least expects it. And so too will the market. The technical reason is that it’s pretty much an 
isolated event on the US Nasdaq. For look at the   S&P500, you can barely tell from the 
weekly chart that it has corrected.   And that’s for the simple reason that it’s 
gone down by a ridiculous -5,5%. As in nothing!   And looking at the overall technical 
picture I can detect no weakness at all. And if we look at the German DAX or the 
Swedish OMXS30 they're both trading at new   all-time highs and haven’t bothered at all about 
following the correctional suit of the US Nasdaq.   Hence, this correction in Nasdaq rather 
tells me it’s a sector-related correction   rather than a market-wide one. And 
given how much further ahead the US   Nasdaq index is compared to any other index, 
this minor correction was way overdue. If anything we’ve just begun our parabolic craze, 
and it’s likely gonna be with us for some time to   come. With that said, it doesn’t mean it can’t 
get stormy. Corrections during euphoric moves   can be particularly dramatic. All I’m saying 
is that the skies are nice and sunny for now. To sum this episode up, the secular trend 
is still intact. And until the technicals   turn sour in accordance to the levels we’ve 
discussed we have no reason whatsoever of   going against the prevalent trend, which is 
up. With that said, it will eventually pay to   keep an eye on the fire exit, for the fire that’s 
coming will burn most retail investors to ashes. I’ll leave you with these words: When the markets 
start to shake from turbulence and volatility,   zoom out. That’s where you’ll find your answers. That was all for now.

35,0Zu_1Byh5uQ," hey everybody welcome to this quick tutorial on the Nasdaq specifically we're going to talk about both the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq 100 my name is Barbara Armstrong I'm a coach with TD Ameritrade and delighted to be here with you today okay so let's get right down to business and look at what the Nasdaq is all about so first of all when we look at the Nasdaq Composite Index it is a market capitalization weighted index made up of approximately 3,300 common equities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange they include common stocks they include real estate investment trusts or REITs they include American depository receipts now an ADR or American depository receipt is a company Alibaba ticker symbol ba-ba is one example of this of a foreign company this is a Chinese company that has a listing on the Nasdaq and is actively traded here in the United States limited partnerships are listed on the Nasdaq also so this index is not limited to companies solely with US headquarters which sectors make up the Nasdaq Composite Index well this is a tech heavy index technology can came in at 46% and this was as of May 2008 teen consumer services at just over 20% healthcare at almost 11 financials at 8 and a half industrials at 6 consumer goods at almost 5 and a half and then the last four sectors each comprised less than 1% of the Nasdaq Composite Index and those include oil and gas telecommunications basic materials and utilities when we look at the Nasdaq 100 what is that made up of well it is a group of the hundred largest most actively traded US companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange it's just a subset of the now that composit and it's comprised of a hundred and three symbols why a hundred and three because there are three companies that have to share classes represented on the index an alphabet which is Google's parent company is one example of that so you know it has to share classes goog Class C shares and goog L the Class A shares this index is heavily tech weighted and in fact the technology companies currently comprise over 50% of this index and the second largest sector is consumer services you know which one you consider we've got the behemoth Amazon in there that's almost 25% of this index currently and then our other sectors are healthcare industrials and telecommunications there are no financial services companies represented on the Nasdaq 100 so tech-heavy no financials and this index is weighted based on a modified capitalization methodology and what do we mean by that well if one company becomes so huge that it dominates the index they skew the weighting or chair modify the weighting so which companies make up the top ten well Apple is currently number one at eleven point nine percent with Microsoft nipping at its heels at ten point seven and then Amazon coming in at seven point nine these three together comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the entire Nasdaq 100 then we've got Facebook the two alphabet companies googan Google which together comprise eight point six percent then Intel Comcast Cisco Systems and PepsiCo rounding out our top ten the Nasdaq 100 is comprised of a hundred companies men which are names that are familiar in households across the country companies like Costco Starbucks Dollar Tree Lululemon Kraft Heinz Monster beverages eBay and t-mobile among others so these are companies that are part of many Americans everyday lives I hope this has shed some light on what the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq Composite Index are all about I

37,UJrRCQXBJDU," Hey traders Raghee here and we're going to take a 
look at what is next for the indices so I'm going   to start this off with something a little bit 
different that I do with volume weighted average   price levels and so if you took the sub-market 
secrets no sub-market sonar although there were   some market secrets too but if you took the 
sub-market sonar class back in 2018-19 whenever   we did it one of the things that I recommended 
is to anchor multiple V-WAPs lots of them first   of the year first of the month rolling 10-day IPOs 
earnings major volume events I mean that's just a   handful of them and so another thing that you can 
do is focus on these minor lows and minor highs   like so and what you can do if you anchor them 
and I do not use rolling volume average price   if you anchor them what you'll get is that 
right there and that right there so traders have   been asking me is the Nasdaq going to break out 
what's next for tech and my answer is no in fact   this move was really not of any consequence quite 
frankly any more than this move higher was of any   consequence is today's move of any consequence no 
why now if you're trading a one-minute time frame   of course it's a different conversation but we're 
talking about within the scope of this daily   of this daily market all right and why do i say 
that because we're stuck in a range gang and   when would we make a move that is likely 
going to be a momentum generating game changer   getting above these swing highs sure getting 
above the V-WAP I think closing above the V-WAP   that upper V-WAP is going to be huge we need to 
close above that level so what's next for the Nas   probably a lot more chop until we get through the 
upper end by the way I am optimistic for movement   but this is when I want to build that position 
down as close as I can to the support level from   the V-WAP all right so then we move on to the 
S&P well the S&P is always caught in a bit of   a tug of war between the Nasdaq and the Dow so 
the S&P has been performing better than the Nas   because of the Dow we'll get to the down a moment 
so if you ask me what's next for the S&P right now   it's not a perfect example but being in the 
wave looks pretty good and we have some nice   volume levels through here in fact we have I have 
multiple volume profiles anchored so that means i   have actually three volume profiles that means I 
have three points of control on based on different   look backs and you'll notice they're all coming 
in at this area these white lines cutting across   the chart so that's going to be an interesting 
gravitational pull notice they're not impenetrable   but rather they seem to have a certain 
amount of gravitational pull to price action   if we can stay above the 55 I think that bodes 
very well for the S&P but much like the Nas the S&P  should be traded more at a sector level or even 
individual stock level because the chop and it's   prolonged chop at this point that brings us to 
the Dow the Dow is double green I can play the dow   straight up I can buy pullbacks into the wave I 
can buy pullbacks into the 21 have some decent   volume levels here that's fine double green opens 
the door to trend follows in a much cleaner way   it also means that the double green sectors 
within the Dow are going to be far better for us   to focus on financials just pull back but they 
just went yellow so this is hardly a trend that's   broken it's just one that sort of lost its swagger 
a little bit but in the immortal words of Charles   Dow which I'm going to paraphrase now how long 
have we been green respect the trend that was one   set of at this point sort of entangled 
8 13 21 and 34 EMAs is not enough to   shake me off the XLF in fact we're long right 
now in the sector secrets but in the futures   room we're focused on more long positions in the 
Dow that's where the trend is right now that's   what's next I believe for indices we're going 
to be coming up to probably a pretty volatile   end of month as the rebalancing persists but I'm 
not sure that if you take a look at the calendar   we still have quite a few days we have another 
week and so just be aware that your more   conservative entry levels might be the ones that 
you should focus on right now I'll see you in the   next update without Simpler Trading I could not 
have financial in the past this is one of the best   investments I ever made in my life it's helping 
me find consistency one of the things that won me",nasdaq,"['Hey', 'traders', 'Raghee', 'here', 'and', 'we', 're', 'going', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'look', 'at', 'what', 'is', 'next', 'for', 'the',

glossary of financial terms and events. Our word of the day is “NASDAQ”
The NASDAQ is a global electronic marketplace for buying and selling securities, as well
as the benchmark index for U.S. technology stocks. NASDAQ was created by the National Association
of Securities Dealers to enable investors to trade securities on a computerized, speedy
and transparent system, and commenced operations on February 8, 1971. The NASDAQ computerized trading system was
initially devised as an alternative to the inefficient “specialist” system, which
had been the prevalent model for almost a century. The rapid evolution of technology has made
the NASDAQ’s electronic trading model the standard for markets worldwide. As a leader in trading technology from the
outset, it was only fitting that the world’s technology giants chose to list on the NASDAQ
in their early days. As the technology sector grew in prominence
in the 1980s and 1990s, the NASDAQ became the most widely followed proxy for this sector.",nasdaq,"['Welcome', 'to', 'the', 'Investors', 'Trading', 'Academy', 'talking', 'glossary', 'of', 'financial', 'terms', 'and', 'events', 'Our', 'word', 'of', 'the', 'day', 'is', 'NASDAQ', 'The', 'NASDAQ', 'is', 'a', 'global', 'electronic', 'marketplace', 'for', 'buying', 'and', 'selling', 'securities', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'the', 'benchmark', 'index', 'for', 'U', 'S', 'technology', 'stocks', 'NASDAQ', 'was', 'created', 'by', 'the', 'National', 'Association', 'of', 'Securities', 'Dealers', 'to', 'enable', 'investors', 'to', 'trade', 'securities', 'on', 'a', 'computerized', 'speedy', 'and', 'transparent', 'system', 'and', 'commenced', 'operations', 'on', 'February', '8', '1971', 'The', 'NASDAQ', 'computerized', 'trading', 'system', 'was', 'initially', 'devised', 'as', 'an', 'alternative', 'to', 'the', 'inefficient', 'specialist', 'system', 'which', 'had', 'been', 'the', 'prevalent', 'model', 'for', 'almost', 'a', 'century', 'The', 'rapid', 'evolution', 'of', 'technology', 'has', 'made', 'the', 'NASDAQ', 's', 'electronic', 'trading', 'model', 'the', 'standard', 'for', 'markets', 'worldwide', 'As', 'a', 'leader', 'in', 'trading', 'technology', 'from', 'the', 'outset', 'it', 'was', 'only', 'fitting', 'that', 'the', 'world', 's', 'technology', 'giants', 'chose', 'to', 'list', 'on', 'the', 'NASDAQ', 'in', 'their', 'early', 'days', 'As', 'the', 'technology', 'sector', 'grew', 'in', 'prominence', 'in', 'the', '1980s', 'and', '1990s', 'the', 'NASDAQ', 'became', 'the', 'most', 'widely', 'followed', 'proxy', 'for', 'this', 'sector']"
39,OaBFvzgKubQ," Adena, thank you so much for welcoming WayUp
into this incredible studio I'm amazed this is awesome your your office is
amazing thank you for those who don't know you're the CEO of Nasdaq which is an incredible job but for many people who might not know you also started your
career at Nasdaq as an intern right I did yes I did start as an intern incredible so I have a lot of questions for you all about that but let's start
back to your college MBA days tell me what was it that made you even want to
apply to work at NASDAQ in the first place yeah so the things that made me
think about applying to Nasdaq at that time were the fact that when I was in
business school I had two interests one was in finance and the other was in
product management and it's kind of an interesting combination to do product
management in the financial services industry and what was really interesting
is it and then I found out about Nasdaq and Nasdaq was at that time a pretty
young Stock Exchange but an electronic exchange and what I heard about the
company was it really is in a way a technology product company within a
financial space so I decided to apply to Nasdaq to see whether I could get into
the product management roles here at Nasdaq even though you know in the
financial space it was kind of a kind of an interesting combination that I was
able to find amazing and you were coming out of your MBA at the time I was yes so you're applying for this Nasdaq internship you find out you get
it tell me a little bit about what it was like interning at Nasdaq sure well
interning at Nasdaq at that time actually was pretty unstructured so we
were still a pretty young company we were a subsidiary of a larger
organization called the National Association of Securities Dealers which
is a little known fact and we are based in Washington DC which is also a little
known fact and so we were a for-profit organization within a membership
not-for-profit organization and at that time I think that the company had had
its huge amount of success launching and then growing this new exchange based on
electronic trading and they'd started to get to the point where they had a lot of
success with companies that had not qualified for New York when they when
they came to Nasdaq but then had become really big companies. Apple, Microsoft,
Applied Materials, Intel those were all companies listed on
Nasdaq that and decided at that point let's stay on NASDAQ in it so we had
really started to develop out all of the different ways for us to trade those
products to treat other instruments beyond just stocks and we were really
trying to find our way as a for-profit organization so I came in as the only
intern in the group I was in the trading group they did have interns in the
listing side but none in the trading side and so it was really kind of fun to
be the only intern in the group do you remember some of the things that when
you were an intern that really stuck out to you as memorable as as fun as you
know even just defining of your career well the most memorable part of the
internship really was the fact that I had to find my own way so they said okay
you're gonna come in and you're gonna write business plans for this trading
product called ACES and another product called PORTAL and I thought and then
they said oh of course you have an MBA so you know how to write a business plan
and I was like oh yeah of course well I had no idea how to write it back
so I loved it and back then the internet really hadn't really kind of blossomed
yet so it was really a matter of going and doing my own research and saying
okay what is it that really defines a business plan or the components of it
and then to find my way through the organization find experts on these
products really helped me understand the legal side of it the technology side of
it the the business side of it and it was a lot of fun because I really was
kind of finding my own way through the organization and that is actually what
define my career you know at the end of the day I think that one of the great
things about NASDAQ is you can find your way into the organization in one group
and then move into other parts the company and that really was and but you
have to have your own sense of self-reliance
you know self starting and that certainly was a good way a good way for
me to learn that early on amazing so I'm talking to someone who started out as an intern became a CEO I think a lot of interns dream of working full time at
the companies they interned and even maybe rising the ranks are you the only
person who ever interned at Nasdaq and continued to stay there and grow and
their careers or are there many of you? there are actually many of us now so
after I had my internship and as the company continued to mature we started
to have a more regular internship program and so we now have a lot of a
lot of our employees who used to be interns or one of them is running sales
in our data group one of them is in the product management team and our in our
data group we also have people in our HR organization marketing organization or
finance and legal organization all of whom started off as interns so it really
is actually a great great way to get started here at NASDAQ incredible ok so
thinking back to your younger self you're in MBA in college you're applying
for internships you're probably freaking out about what the heck you're gonna do
with your life what advice do you have for your younger self if you could like
write a message in a bottle send it back in time well the first thing to remember
is that a career is 40 years long so it is really important to recognize that
you're not you're not starting a sprint you're starting a marathon and you want
to really think through it doesn't mean your first job does not need to be the
perfect job but with each of the jobs that you have you want to learn
something about it you want to decide what you like and what you don't like
it's actually frankly a huge amount of value in learning what you like but also
learning what you don't like to do and allow yourself to kind of take those
early years whether it's through the internship programs you do in college or
whether it's through the first couple of jobs you have to truly really try to
hone in on what is what it makes you excited to come to work every day I mean
how do you use your intellect how do you use your curiosity to really drive you
and motivate you and if you kind of take those early years to do that that will
honestly set you on the better path for your longer your longer career so let's talk Impostor Syndrome I think a lot of young adults young
professionals might have this kind of notion of impostor syndrome when they
start a career when they're even applying for an internship and there's a
million-in-one statistics about how women tend to hold back from applying
for a job if they don't have every qualification any advice for young
professionals who might have that impostor syndrome do you have impostor
syndrome well when I was really early in my career I was offered a couple of
promotions along the way and there were definitely times when I said wow I'm
kind of surprised they think that I'm the right person but I said absolutely I
love that job that sounds awesome and then you sit there and say okay I'm
going to figure this out and and you definitely realize that everyone else
around you is having the same sentiment right anyone else who's kind of entering
into new job and taking on new responsibilities
realizes if they have a lot to learn and the big thing is that you have to get
over that fear because I say that stretching yourself is almost like
building new muscles and that kind of muscle memory has to develop over time
so keep putting yourself into uncomfortable situations and you'll
develop that muscle where it goes from having fear to having excitement and so
by the time that I was in the middle of my career and moving up up until
certainly you know the last couple chances I've had I really didn't have
any fear at all it really was I think I am ready for this I'm you know I know
that I can take on the additional responsibility I know that I can I can
do this job well but it all came from those early years where you had to force
yourself into situations that made you uncomfortable amazing so I would assume
when you felt uncomfortable there were role models or mentors in your life I
know that your parents pay the big role in helping you think through pros and
cons of your career tell me a little bit about some the role models in your life yeah so my biggest role model well are my parents actually so I would say both
of them together one of them because my father worked in the financial services
industry his whole career and worked extremely hard throughout his career but
it obviously rewarded him as he went through so he ended his career as the in
the last ten years as the chief investment officer T. Rowe Price and he
really had done a huge amount to impact the success of that company you have a
power family I hope you know that that was really to me to watch his work
ethic to watch him really form the basis of that company and and the kind of
success it has today I think was hugely inspiring to me and my mom had been a
stay-at-home mom she was a stay-at-home mom until I was nine and then she went
back to law school and when I was 11 she became a lawyer and over the next few
years she became actually the first woman partner in her law firm but the
fact that she was able to find that balance you know she was always you I
wouldn't say she was always home for dinner because my dad actually had to
start coming home and making dinner occasionally but she was always there
when I needed her regardless of the thing that was going anything that was
going on around her and at the same time she was hugely successful in her own
profession and so to me those were really great role models and I know not
everyone has the benefit of role models who can kind of shape
their career but you do want to make sure that even if you don't have them in
your side your own family that you look for them within your your professional
life you look at them look for them in your personal life and and try to make
sure that you have a chance to interact with them and have them help you along
the way awesome my final two questions for people watching who might be
considering applying for an internship or a full-time role at Nasdaq tell me a
little bit about the culture here the culture at Nasdaq is kind of an
interesting combination so we call it collaborative command so for a long time
I think the company as it was growing really fast and as we are dealing with a
lot of acquisitions we had really a command-and-control culture which means
a lot of decision making funneled up to the top of the organization and given
how quickly we had to make decisions and how fast the environment was moving I
think that it was actually an important stage in our in our evolution but today
I think that we are a very innovative company we're a tech company we have a
lot of organic opportunities for us to move forward and it's still a very
dynamic environment but we're very skilled so now it's a matter of making
sure we get all the best ideas in the room we really think them through
together and then we make a very definitive decision and once that
decision is made we march forward together so that to me is that
combination of collaboration but then also having the command and the
decision-making authority to kind of move fast and that's the kind of culture
we try to instill here awesome all right my last question for you someone is
watching this they decide alright I want to be the future CEO of Nasdaq I'm gonna
start as an intern they apply maybe it's their first time job at a first job out
of college what interview advice do you have for someone who maybe finds out
that they have an interview at Nasdaq and has no idea where to start preparing yeah well the first thing is you do want to do the research there's so much
available online and I know that you know our site our website gives a lot of
information there's obviously a lot of news and other sources of information
about Nasdaq make sure not only that you understand Nasdaq but you understand
who's you know who's in the senior management ranks so who and what job are
you actually interviewing for because we do have a pretty broad spectrum of
opportunities here so make sure you understand the job understand you know
ultimately how it reports up into the organization and understand the company
so that you can have an intelligent conversation with the interviewer I mean
that's just kind of job number one I think the other thing that we look for
in all of our candidates is intellectual curiosity you know understanding or
wanting to understand more about the world around them wanting to understand
more about the capital markets and how they've they shaped the economy
understanding that we actually are not just the capital market for the US but
we are also the capital markets in the Nordics and we provide the technology
that powers over a hundred other markets around the world so it's a really
interesting that intellectual curiosity is also gonna play very well in the
interview amazing well thank you so much again for for having this conversation
it's incredible and I think anyone who could work here would be very lucky so
thank you so much thank you so much, thank you",nasdaq,"['Adena', 'thank', 'you', 'so', 'much', 'for', 'welcoming', 'WayUp', 'into', 'this', 'incredible', 'studio', 'I', 'm', 'amazed', 'this', 'is',

40,a_Wv4je6hwI," I am attorney Laura Anthony founding partner
of Legal & Compliance, a full service corporate, securities, and business transactions law
firm. Today is the final LawCast in a series discussing
NASDAQ listing requirements. There are many benefits to trading on an exchange
such as NASDAQ. The biggest benefit to an exchange is the
ability to attract analyst coverage and institutional investors, and the corresponding increase
in liquidity that comes with both. Stocks that trade on NASDAQ tend to have a
lower bid/offer spread than over the counter securities, again, encouraging trading volume
and liquidity. Importantly, exchange traded securities are
exempt from the penny stock definition, allowing for more market maker and broker-dealer participation. A broker-dealer cannot recommend a penny stock
transaction to its retail customers, and therefore, no analysts, financial advisors, or institutional
investors make recommendations for purchases of penny stocks. And, in general, no institutional investors
invest in penny stocks. As an aside, this is one of the reasons that
OTC Markets created the OTCQX Market tier, which does not list penny stocks. It is also the reason that the small- and
micro-cap industry is pushing for a supported venture exchange. A designated venture market would be one for
small-cap companies, which would allow for higher brokerage and trading commissions,
be exempt from the prohibitive penny stock rules, and which securities would be considered
covered securities under federal securities laws and thus exempt from separate blue sky
compliance. I think that the OTC Markets has the foundation
to set the OTCQX as a recognized venture exchange platform and would love to see it gain regulatory
support in that regard, including blue sky pre-emption. In today’s world it is increasingly difficult
to deposit and/or trade in non-exchange traded securities. Despite the congressional efforts and SEC
rulemaking in support of small and micro-cap capital formation — for example, the JOBS
Act, including the emerging growth company regulations and IPO on-ramp. New Regulation A+ and Title III Crowdfunding
and the new FAST Act – through enforcement and investigative proceedings, both the SEC
and FINRA continue to apply pressure on broker-dealers, clearing firms and transfer agents, resulting
in a reduction in a secondary trading and free flow of low priced securities. Although these issues need to be addressed
on a broader basis, securities listed on NASDAQ and other national exchanges do not face many
of these issues. Also as mentioned, exchange traded securities
are considered covered securities for purposes of blue sky compliance. That is, transactions with exchange traded
securities are exempted from separate state blue sky law registration and exemption requirements. I am securities attorney Laura Anthony, founding
partner of Legal & Compliance, and producer of LawCast. Should you have any questions about today’s

41,WOHa4tq_jqQ," O INVESTORS AND LESLIE PICKER HAS  THE DETAILS. HEY, LESLIE. >> HEY, TYLER. THAT'S RIGHT THE REAL TARGET OF THIS LETTER IS REGULATORS. BUT IN DOING SO HE POINTS OUT  ACTIVITIES TAKEN BY DAVID AND  ROBINHOOD AMID THE WHOLE GAMESTOP VOLATILITY SAGA THAT  TOOK PLACE EARLIER THIS YEAR HE POINTS TO ROBINHOOD SAYING IT SUSPENDED TRADING IN CERTAIN STOCKS BECAUSE IT WAS  UNDERCAPITALIZED IT WAS POSSIBLE, HE SAID, THAT IT WASN'T FOLLOWING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND A RELATORY  SANCTION IS PROBABLY NECESSARY DECLINED TO COMMENT IN RESPONSE  TO THIS LETTER FROM EINHORN AND  ELON MUSK HE NOTES THE REAL JET  FUEL CAME WHOSE APPEARANCES ON TV AND TWITTER RESPECTIVELY AT A CRITICAL MOMENT FURTHER  DESTABILIZED THE SITUATION HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT HAS BEEN  DONE THROUGH A DSPAC WHICH COMPETES WITH ROBINHOOD HE NOTES AND LEFT US WITH THE IMPRESSION  THAT BY DESTABILIZING GME, HE  COULD HARM A COMPETITOR. AND THEN HE ALSO GOES ON TO SAY  THAT HE HALF HEARTEDLY WANTS TO  DEFEND MUSK BECAUSE IF REGULATORS WANTED MUSK TO STOP MANIPULATING STOCKS THEY SHOUL HAVE DONE SO WITH MORE THAN A  LIGHT SLAP ON THE WRIST WHEN THEY ACCUSED OF MANIPULATING STOCKS BACK IN 2014. A LONG-TIME BEAR ON TESLA. HE HASN'T PROVIDED AN UPDATE ON  HIS POSITIONING IN STHIS LETTER  BUT HAS BEEN CRITICAL IN THE PAST WITH REGARD TO REGULATION, HE  SAYS FOR THE MOST PART NO COP ON THE BEAT IT'S AS IF THERE ARE NO  FINANCIAL FRAUD PROSECUTORS TO ENGAGE IN MALFESANCE HAVE LITTLE TO FEAR. HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT MANY WHO  WOULD HAVE NEVER SUPPORTED DEFUNDING THE POLICE HAVE  SUPPORTED AND FOR ALL INTENTS  AND PURPOSES HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ALMOST COMPLETELY DEFANGING IF NOT DEFUNDING THE REGULATORS HE SAYS FOR THE MOST PART  QUASI-AN AARCHY APPEARS TO RULE  THE MARKETS. A NICE ANTIC DOTE TOWARDS THE  END OF THIS LETTER IT IS PUBLICLY TRADED AND OWNS A SINGLE DELI IN RURAL NEW JERSEY  AND THAT DELI HAD ABOUT $14,000  OF SALES IN 2020 IT WAS CLOSED DUE TO COVID IN  MARCH THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF LAST  YEAR AND THEN SOMEHOW MANAGED TO REACH A MARKET CAP OF $113 MILLION. SO, HE POINTS TO THAT AS JUST  ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF SOME UNIQUE  ASPECTS THAT ARE GOING IN THE  MARKET AND NOTES I THINK IN A  JOKING MANNER THAT IT MUST HAVE  SOME VERY GOOD PASTRAMI. WE'VE REACHED OUT IN ADDITION TO ROBINHOOD TO PALIHAPITIYA AND  ELON MUSK. IF THEY DO DECIDE TO COMMENT,  WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, GUYS. >> WOW, REALLY INTERESTING STUFF, LESLIE.

42,QM-0z5BDIQE, hi chicken gang and friends i'm super pumped for this video that's why i'm standing up so are you confused on what's happening on gme stock and you want a summary of it i've been getting quite a lot of requests so in this video i will talk about why the retail investors are pissed how they come together and how all of this is going to play out at the end anyway i appreciate an early thumbs up for the lgo and supporting my course thank you so much so hedge funds had always had this unfair advantage they control the media they get in the trades before us and leaving the retail investors stopping all the losses and for all the corrections they cause jobs and homes the people have lost for all the people who can't afford a decent freaking life while wall street gets rich and for all the times they got bailout with tax money so this story is not about money it's about sending a message is about everyday people coming together fighting the big boys do you remember tesla stopped before the run up many retail investors were fighting the fud back in 2016 before my youtube days i was actively speaking on stage about tesla well this donkey melvin capital has been shooting tesla since 2016 and this is sweet donkey revenge i'll link their trades below we retail investors are sick of the big boys the hedge funds burning retail investors tremendous and elon musk has joined the fight with us some of xiaomi stocks like virgin galactic is highly shorted with 30 short float elon musk is also joining the fight tesla almost went poof because of the short sellers pushing the stock price down back in the early days 2016 2017 this is the sweetest revenge now elon is in a better place tesla is a much better place the story couldn't get better by the way my next video will be on tesla i'm going to do something crazy to my portfolio and something that i'll talk i'll never do so stay tuned so the story told in about one minute a few months ago wall street bets had about two million followers i think now three million someone on wall street bets noticed that a hedge fund had taken a massive shock position against gamestop gme was shorted 130 percent and this means for every 100 shares there is 130 shares that need to be bought back like how is this possible adding to that they noticed gme had a good cash position jeremy could easily like buy back all their shares and burn the shots so a bunch of redditors on wall street bets convinced everyone on the track to join forces and buy as much game stock stock as possible this made several hedge funds lost billions of dollars melbourne capital that donkey that shorted tesla had to borrow money to cover their shots else they will go into bankruptcy the act of covering a short position is buying the stock so this caused gme to shoot out further to this infinite uphill climb the hedge fund is now in [ __ ] so redditors are still now searching for other hedge funds to burn the big boys are now screaming is illegal but hey they really lost their own gay man so how all of this is gonna end game stop will eventually come back to fair value not the four dollar stock but probably if you apply a pretty lousy pe to or price to book ratio you'll bring the stock back up to maybe 20 30 fundamentally gamestop business model is not relevant my real worry is actually robin hood blowing up it is a slight chance and in running multiple businesses this was what i learned if it's an operational problem it can be fixed but if it's a reputation problem good luck fixing it is going to take years and in those years the business may go up in flames like all crashes it starts from one entity falling causing this domino effect i suggest robin hood investors to move their money out to cash app i hope this whole gme saga will not be the starting point of the next crash anyway wrapping up from the start i pump a little money in to send a message and ready to lose it all if you are in this for the profit you are in the wrong place we thought 2021 couldn't be more dramatic for the past few days the internet blew up and it came together cnbc's coverage on this whole saga is almost 24 hours it's everywhere on twitch on fox news i haven't been entertained for such a long time the story of david versus goliath has always been my thing you see from what i do now like always giving real good information free no money involved so i'm never biased you may appreciate the thumbs up i hope i summarize all this well and as always invest safe you,GME,"['hi', 'chicken', 'gang', 'and', 'friends',

44,yayaNNlxjKk," if you are watching and you have bought some gme 
or amc or any other meme stock in the past few   weeks that means you have a morbid curiosity for 
pain as for someone as part of the bought in at   250 plus club uh i have to say this bag is getting 
really heavy to hold but there is still hope in   this video i want to talk very briefly about what 
there is left to do to swing gme back this week   and try to bring it to the moon before too many 
people lose interest my name is andrew in this   channel we talk not just exclusively about gme we 
talk about personal finance we talk about exactly   how to get you up to making six figures so that 
you can buy more gme stock but most importantly   today i'm gonna tell you why you should like this 
video subscribe to this channel to hear exactly   what's coming up next on gme i have a video coming 
out at 6 30 a.m pst it's going to cover a lot   about the state of gme exactly when the squeeze is 
going to be squeezing and a lot more information   that you need to understand it's going to be the 
gme briefing to end all gme briefing but for today   i want to tell you why gme can still be a great 
play user g n a dami says to all the people   still want to go to the moon i have the ticket 
right here one eight one seven four two four two   zero zero one this is the officially dedicated 
investor relations number of gamestop any gme   shareholders can call in and an answering machine 
will take your call go on record with your full   name number of shares and the country you're based 
in tell them you have a reason to believe that   an emergency shareholder vote has to be called in 
order to save the company from bankruptcy calling   the vote means calling shares back to their owners 
eliminating all synthetic stock and therefore   taking leverage away from fraudulent short 
sellers see the hedge funds still have shorts   that they have not fulfilled yet so therefore 
we need to have some sort of shock to the system   to prevent the paper handers as well as everyone 
else who is selling panic selling to expedite   what needs to happen to show hedge funds and wall 
street a lesson if anything if you're like me   who is still holding on to a lot of gme stock you 
are teaching the hedge funds a lesson with each   passing day they have to pay millions of interest 
and they are trying trying their best to make it   seem like it's all over it's not over because i 
did not hear no bell this template down below i'm   going to include in the description it says hello 
my name is blank i currently own blank shares of   gamestop stocks i have reason to believe that 
brokerage firms and the clearinghouses i've used   to make trades have created synthetic stock 
positions with no ability to actually follow   through with them just like in america democracy 
rules so this is the action you can take to try   and drive it back up to the moon at the very 
least show the hedge funds that you mean business   that you are here to stay that you will have the 
diamond hands only if and this is the caveat all   of this is not financial advice it's only 
for entertainment however most importantly   if you have the ability to continue holding then 
hold if you have the ability to continue buying   then buy however if you need to support someone 
like a lot of these comments have mentioned if   you don't understand exactly what you're getting 
yourself into this is a gamble this has always   been a gamble but now at the end game it's really 
important for you to understand that none of this   is a guarantee so if you have someone to support 
pull out while you can support that person   and now that wall street has been given a message 
the next wave be a gamestop or some other company   is going to be even bigger than this one because 
i like you guys i'm going to go through a couple   of memes that brought a smile to my face we have 
uh this guy who has lost a hundred and seventy   two thousand dollars negative eighty percent yeah 
uh how can i possibly relate to this guy i wonder   uh it is it must feel like buying at the very 
beginning of the great depression or the 2008   recession but as of right now how much more 
money can they possibly even take away from   you this sub has done a complete 180. think back 
to wednesday of last week gme was going up amc was   going up nokia was going up this subreddit was 
electric i've never seen such a strong sense of   community and unity from a group of people online 
it was truly a marvel to hold the united front of   retail investors on here working together and 
encouraging other people to make big gains and   destroy wall street while we were at it we got 
attention of chamath elon paper hands portnoy   cuban and other people on both sides of the 
island washington they were on our side rooting   for us they were inspired by us and the momentum 
that was created here i can't think of any other   subreddit to gain that much attention from big 
players thursday is when they realize that we   became a truly strong force to be reckoned with 
and started all the market manipulation and   brokerage restrictions but we only became stronger 
the obvious slap to the face from robin hood only   emboldened us wall street bets was infiltrated by 
bots and hedges trying to instill fear and panic   and push other stocks to sell to cause sell-offs 
but we saw right through them and held now i take   a look at wall street bets this week and i can't 
help to think what happened to everyone's spines   i thought you guys got off on these kind of losses 
what happened to all the passion you had last week   three days of no big gains and that's all it 
takes for you guys to sell and run crying to   your wife's boyfriend's pathetic uh you guys 
thought the hedgies were going to go down easy   no if we want to create change in the market 
on a grand scale to even the playing field with   wall street and actually bend them over for once 
instead of getting instead of us getting shafted   then we need to be resilient we need to hold 
together wall street sees us as cockroaches and   we are trying to shine spotlights on us to scatter 
us little do they know we can survive a nuclear   winter and come back stronger the war is far from 
over do not desert your fellow apes in combat now   too long didn't read age strong together must 
remain together to stay strong bananas are right   for the taking you may lose some money you may 
make some money but please don't lose your hatred   for the one percent eat the rich upvote if you're 
holding for the second wave we got this i'm so   excited this is just from an hour ago i bought 
another 72 shares i know this is gonna explode   again and we're gonna give a big message to the 
hedge funds this is a hundred percent proof that   gamestop is literally in countdown to launch phase 
okay fellow mongoloids i truly believe i figured   this [ __ ] out i've been neglecting sleep and 
insufflating copious amounts of colombian blow   just so that i can remain symbiotically attached 
to every shred of current market data i can find   about gamestop and its current trajectory 
so i'm basically an expert at this point   and so is my cousin who used to work for a nasa 
contractor in cocoa beach florida this basically   puts me on par with that kramer guy or whatever 
anyway here's a snapshot of where we stand today okay i agree a concerning uppy downy 
thing for some but a harbinger of extreme   stratospheric ascension for the better informed 
among us now i want to draw your attention to   the dimensions of the three-sided polygon aka 
triangle that i created by referencing a few   points that seemed highly sus and therefore worth 
referencing the result of my wizardry is thus yeah that's good i use black because of the 
color of my soul when i think about how evil   the hedge fund guys are in comparison to the 
paragons of virtue here on wall street pets now   this is where it gets interesting i knew there 
was something uncanny about the shape of this   triangle i knew that i'd seen this exact triangle 
before in relation to advanced rocketry but i   wasn't sure where so i contacted my dealer boofed 
another eight ball uh and got to work meticulously   pouring through all the available data 
until bam i found it feast your eyes on this okay just another fancy firework from 
our friends at nasa's jet propulsion lab   not so fast notice something peculiar you 
don't of course you don't because you haven't   studied this [ __ ] to death like i 
have if we focus on just the first half   second of this gif we get this then 
when zoom and enhance we get this see where i'm going with this if 
now let me make it crystal clear   so you don't have to marshal all six of 
your brain cells to see what's going on here these three-sided polygons are the same i mean 
not exactly but it's god damn close enough to   call it and i'm calling it if you're not 100 
convinced that gme is literally about to go   vertical you simply aren't paying attention 
it's not my fault you can't understand basic   math geometry and astrophysics okay my work is 
done here after we've all made our millions i   wouldn't mind being handsomely compensated for the 
selfless efforts i've expended just so that you   mouth breathers can have some fun money to throw 
around at your retirement parties you're welcome   okay now that we have gotten the math out of 
the way i hope you guys enjoyed a little bit   of the fun this is obviously not news this 
is just a meme if you wanted to check out a   couple of the other posts on wall street bets

45,LTssDfXRGvY," Good morning, it's Clay at claytrader.com. This will be a live trade video where I try to capture my
trades as they play out live. Real quick, before I get
started, before the market opens, when I say live, what I mean
is that this is not a situation where everything has been recorded and now I'm coming back
and talking about it or doing a voiceover, some
sort of post-commentary. I'm recording myself,
seeing the information for the very first time. So if you want raw
thoughts, raw reactions, raw emotions, you will get that. If you want a nicely edited
video, nicely scripted video, you're not gonna get that here, but if you want a nitty gritty
look into what it's like to be a day trader, how
day trading can play out, then yeah, you're definitely
gonna find that here. So think I'm gonna watch GME
out of the opening gates. Yes, I am actually gonna watch it. Coming to life here a little bit. There are actually shares available to short now on this one, which is what that green
E on my screen represents. So the markets are now officially open. And we'll see what it wants to do, although U was just going
pretty bonkers right before. Yeah. So I'm gonna watch this one actually. Looks good. Although you can't do
anything with it right now when it's going straight down. I mean, that would be totally chasing. So we'll see how this
thing wants to play out. Tesla, what is that? Okay, Tesla already made. GME is still just dropping. Yeah, I think U. That one's definitely catching. I don't even know, 128 as a test. Can I even do five? That's weird. Oh, symbol. No, I typed it on the wrong thing. No wonder why. All right, well, not just
kind of a whole lot of, or GME actually does look interesting at the $70 mark, but... Nah, not as good as what
I thought it was looking. All right, I am gonna go
ahead and pause for now. All right, watching 126 here. As a potential area to get short. If it wants to come back
down, but as of right now, it's going the total opposite direction. So maybe that's not even
gonna come into play here. Oh, if you do hear typing, that's just me making alerts
over in my live chat room. So if you're not familiar, I
do offer a community there. So that's what you hear. You're not, MVIS, you're
not hearing things. Maybe 66 is a... potential area to short here on GME. Although I definitely
do want to see this one play out a little bit more. So all right, I'm gonna go ahead. Wow, and look at U now go
the total opposite direction. What's going on with DKNG here? Oh, wow. Let me get that alerted. Wow, what a gap and trap. To think that there were some people that bought up there on that gap. Hopefully they're not still holding. Brutal. All right, I'm gonna go ahead and pause. GME down at 66, which
I talked about earlier. I think I talked about it too. I can't remember, but I did make an alert in the chat room right
here as a flush point. But I don't want to take it right now, but if this thing can at
least start to go sideways, sideways, and then head back down, I would find that very interesting, especially now that it's
bounced off it again. So yeah, 66 has now become
that much more interesting. So I'm gonna keep a close eye on that and we'll see if that level
can come back into play again. Like I said, I don't want to take it on this particular candle here. Probably not even the next one. Want to see it goes
sideways here a little bit. So even on this candle,
I'm not willing to take it. That might cost me the trade. That might mean that I get left behind, but I'd like, just like I said, a little bit more confirmation. But not on this candle,
but if on the next candle, it looks like it wants
to break down through 66, then I will take that trade,
but we'll see what happens. And again, this is not prerecorded, so I don't know what's gonna happen. Maybe that trade will
never come into play. Maybe I'm not gonna get left in its dust. I don't know, but that's
just my mindset right now and what I want to see. So I'll go ahead and pause. Okay, watching actually 66.25. That's the area that seems to be more so that confirmation point. But I'm also watching the five minute. So I want to see this candle
stay above it too, actually. But next candle, I will like
it extremely, extremely much. So hopefully this candle
can stay up above it. But I think if 66.25 goes, it's got a good chance of pushing down. But like I said, I don't want
to take it on this candle. So I'm gonna go ahead and pause. All right, the next candle has started. It's gone green, so I
love it that much more. 66.25 will be the level that
I'll be watching closely. You can see right there, 66.25
update on the flush point, But definitely wanted confirmation, 'cause right to be fair, maybe this is some sort of bottoming and this thing's getting
ready to head back up. That's always a possibility too, but we'll see what happens. And just like that. Wow. That's why you got away for confirmation. So as of now, looking like a 66.25 is, attractive as it was, is now out of play. I mean, it could come back into play, but now looking like I'll
probably do some looking around. All right, wow. That fast it came back down to 66.25. And has once again bounced off that level. So failed, bounce up. Do not want to take it
on this candle though. No way. No way. And I don't care if it
costs me or not, but... Do not feel comfortable at all taking it on this particular candle. But yeah, I mean, there is definitely a line in the sand being
drawn here right around 66.25. So I will go ahead and pause again, but. Now I'm gonna keep it going on this. It seems though 66.30 is more so that key area. And I missed it. Can I get some on the back test? Got some on the back test. Let's see if we can get that
push down through, there we go. All out there for a quick $300. Excellent. Well, the patience paid off. Had to wait and wait and
wait and stalk that thing. But you know what? Sometimes patience pays. So very happy. Oh, wow. Tesla almost same thing. Let's go check out Tesla. Wow, deja vu, 868. Oh wow, yep. 868. And to explain GME, I originally
missed the entry point, but I left it out there. The price came back up to me, filled me, and then came back down. But yeah, took a while and I realized, sometimes with the recording
it can get a little annoying. Come on, come on. But like I said, that's
I guess the downside is I could do a highlight reel where you don't have to sit
through those, but again, that's kind of the goal
here is to just give you a realistic look, and sometimes
that's how it's gonna be. You're gonna be like,
okay, it's looking close. Nope, didn't happen. Okay, looking close. Nope, didn't happen. Oh, okay. Well, now it's really bouncing. Now it's probably not gonna happen. Then all of a sudden, oh wow. It's back into play. Okay, finally happened. I mean, like I said, it can be annoying, but that's how it goes. Although for full transparency
sake, I did pick the wrong, the wrong strategy. I picked a scalp, whereas
if I would've let it work for me more, I mean, now it's $2 down below, maybe even more. So those members that selected a different management strategy, again, I alerted the price level, but at that point, it's up
to members to figure out how exactly they want to
manage the trade themselves. So for those that decided to play it as a, no, I want to hold for more. Hey, they chose right. I chose wrong. But that's the nice thing about trading is you can be partially right. And I was partially right. And that was still enough
to put $300 in my pocket after what was it? An eight-second trade? Yeah, eight seconds. So right there, 427 or 9:42:27, 9:42:35. So right there, eight
seconds and then $300. But yes, in hindsight could
have, should have been more. I just chose the wrong
exit strategy for it. So congratulations to members that chose. Oh wow, MRNA. Has that one been alerted? That one's really just grinding. I might just call it good. It's 9:45, 15 minutes, one trade $300. I'm not sure many places in the market where you can make $300 in 15 minutes. But again, Tesla. Fast mover. So what I'm gonna do is just do. Just gonna do 50 shares. 868. Yeah, just 50 shares here. Oh my God (laughs). Okay, well, that just
was not gonna happen. Even with hot keys. Wow, I'm glad I caught
it on video, but nope. that didn't happen. Well, and again, just to
show how the community works, Tesla. Well, I originally made the alert up here. Flush point, one minute. A lot of time went by because
it looked like that level was not gonna happen and then
made another alert right there that it's back into play. But wow! You all saw that movie, or
saw that movie, saw that move. That just happened way too fast. So I mean, for people that
maybe were speculating more, not actually waiting for the confirmation, they would have been in. So that's a good example of how sometimes when you don't wait for confirmation, that's actually the best way to go, because I mean, by
waiting for confirmation, which is what I was doing,
didn't even have a chance. And that was a crazy move. Wow, that was fast! And all caught on video. Maybe that's the cue that
I should just be done. Maybe that was, Clay, listen man. Just go. You got your $300. It's 15 minutes in. But still watching, still
watching around, but all right, well I'm glad at least
caught that in video. 'Cause again, the power
of charts right there. 868, you saw when it was broken. Wow, it dropped down basically
$4 in a matter of 10 seconds. All right, I'll. No, you know what? So to explain things to those
of you that are maybe new, I do what is called the
be-done-in-30 approach. Meaning I'm looking to be on average done every morning after 30 minutes. So yeah, some mornings it'll take a little longer than 30 minutes, but a morning like this, I
mean, it's been 15 minutes. So I'm well below the 30-minute mark. Because I just do
trading as a side hustle, I do this as just a way
to make some extra money. And for me, I do this because I don't need a private jet or a yacht. Now, if you want a yacht, if you want to pop bottles of Cristal or whatever the cool drink is these days, maybe I'm revealing my age
with the Cristal comment, but that that's cool. Go for it. Like, I want you to get
whatever your goals are, but me, father of four
young kids, one on the way, I just want freedom of time. So for me, if I can pull
in $300 in 15 minutes, to me as a side hustle, that's fantastic. I'm more than happy with that. So from the be done in 30 approach, I'm just gonna call it good. And you know, we'll
call it a victory here. And I realize only one trade, but a lot of actually good
lessons with that trade because there was, sometimes
that's how it goes. You have to stalk and stalk and stalk, and then it'll finally work out. But it can be a little
annoying along the way. And then of course,
Tesla, as you saw there, stalked it, but just
all of a sudden, boom. Moved way too fast, and that happens also. But for those of you that do
enjoy these live trade videos, before I go, one final request
on my part, if you like them, please communicate that to me by hitting the like
button, leaving a comment. And I say that because these videos are not the easiest to make. Because they are live,
I have to talk to you. I have to think about
what I'm gonna say to you. I have to think for myself. What do I see? I have to make alerts to the community. So there's a lot going on. And these videos are possible,
they're totally doable, but they're kind of a hassle. But I will keep putting up with
the hassle as long as I know that there's interest
and that you enjoy them. So if you do enjoy them,
if it is worth my time, hit the like button and
then a simple comment, and the comment can be a thumbs up emoji. It can be a sunshine emoji. It can be any emoji you want, but those two things go a long
way in communicating to me that these videos are worth my time and worth the hassle of doing. So please do that. And then also check out
the channel as a whole. There's a lot of good variety there. And if you're interested
in joining the community that I offer,
claytrader.com/team, T-E-A-M. Again, claytrader.com/team. And you can learn more about
the service and the membership and how all that works at that link. But again, if you enjoy
the live trade videos and you want me to keep making them, hit that like button,
leave a simple comment, even it's just a thumbs up emoji and that'll help me out quite a bit. So thanks for hanging out
and everybody take care. First off, thanks so much for
watching the entire video. Real quick, before you go, I want to invite you to a
live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call
it, but it will be me, live, revealing to you
what I've discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee
to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total. I'm gonna cover three keys that have helped me unlock
profitable consistency within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way. The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is
wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use. But in a cruel way, this becomes
a pitfall for many traders. I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the
pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key, when you hear it sounds way too good to
be true, but it's not. And I'll show you how it all works. Then at the end, I open it up for a question and answer session that is, again, totally live. Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up
as it will be recorded. And you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you. Click the image on the screen or click the link down
in the description box so you can get the date and
time and claim your spot, which I should note is
limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event. If you have any questions, let me know. If not, I'll be seeing you soon.",GME,"['Good', 'morning', 'it', 's', 'Clay', 'at', 'claytrader', 'com', 'This', 'will', 'be', 'a', 'live', 'trade', 'video', 'where', 'I', 'try', 'to', 'capture',

46,Pd2SrSEr6Ng," hey guys how's it going it's Andy from magoo 
investing and happy Monday we finally made it   to the last week of the year and I’m expecting 
a very interesting week when it comes to   overall volatility we just had the stimulus 
bill that was finally passed and then I’m   expecting to see a lot of maybe some tax losses 
people are cutting losses on some stocks that   didn't do as well try to make their tax bill 
look better going into the end of the year   today I want to talk about a stock that's 
been skyrocketing for the past couple months   and this has been a stock that I have not talked 
very positively about in the past I think the   two times that I’ve talked about it in the past 
two years are probably two of my most disliked   videos because I had very strong opinions about 
the company but a lot has changed about that   so I’m going to be talking about why it's been 
skyrocketing the past couple months talk about the   power of wall street bets uh and how it's played 
an important role in pushing a lot of stocks up   in the past couple months and then I’m going to 
finish the video making a bull and a bear case   for Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) and then you 
guys are going to have to come up with your   own opinions for how you feel about the 
future of game stock ticker symbol $GME   so before we get started I do have to say that 
I’m not a licensed financial advisor and this is   not financial advice anything you hear in this 
video is just me giving my own opinions on the   stock market and you need to do your own research 
for making any investment decisions also if you've   been enjoying these videos I really appreciate 
it hit that like and subscribe button as would   help my channel out a lot so when we first start 
talking about Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) I want   to first talk about the history of the company 
for the past couple years at least the stock   so here I’m going to put up the five year 
chart and as you can see it's pretty effective   at showing the problems that Gamestop Stock (GME 
Stock) has been having for the past five years   at this point for the majority of the past five 
years the stock has been cratering and this comes   mainly off of the struggles with this 
company as being a physical retailer and   the switch that we've been seeing to digital 
transactions when it comes to video games   and so here's a graphic that I found that shows 
the total amount of spending on video games   over the past couple years and so this data 
only goes back to 2018 so I’m assuming that   especially in 2021 we've seen this huge 
disconnect between retail and video games   with the pandemic and I’m expecting this number to 
be much larger than what we actually see from 2018   and so the company's been struggling for a long 
time and back in 2019 is when I first start to   identify Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) as 
being this company that's really struggling   they have poor earnings and as a result they 
decide to finally cut their dividend anytime   a company completely eliminates their dividend the 
stock market usually sells it off aggressively and   as a result the stock shot down 30 because of that 
news that's why if you go on robin hood right now   and look at Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) it says it 
has a 10 dividend because this is what the payout   ratio or what the yield was before they cut that 
dividend as a result of the stock price cratering   for such a long time as a result of that move 
the company expects to save 160 million dollars   every year in cash so that's a positive thing so 
now I want to talk about some of the reasoning   behind why the stock has recovered in the past 
couple months and so over the past couple years   the only person or well-known investor that I’ve 
heard that has been very bullish on the future at   Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) has been Michael Burry 
from the big short every couple months it would be   released that he bought more shares and that would 
push the stock up a decent amount there was also a   time where he sent a letter to Gamestop Stock (GME 
Stock) management asking the company to continue   its share buyback program this was back when 
the stock was sitting at four dollars and if the   company actually did this that would have been an 
incredible move considering now it's up above 20.   and so anytime Michael Burry came out with a 
report or maybe an open letter to management   the stock price would shoot up like 20 percent 
go to present day and we have been seeing a lot   of similar things with news reports anytime a 
news story comes out that looks positive about   Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) the momentum pushes 
it up so significantly it's usually like a 20   move so there have been three news stories in the 
past couple of months that have really pushed the   stock up from looking like a company that could 
declare bankruptcy in the next couple years   to a stock that is recovered significantly and 
has an incredible amount of momentum behind it   so the first one comes back in September 
when Chewy Stock (CHWY Stock) found her   which is ticker symbol $CHWY . The Chewy Stock 
(CHWY Stock) co-founder Ryan Cohen announces   that he bought a 9.9 percent stake in Gamestop 
Stock (GME Stock) and he wants to quote compete   with amazon and so this shoots up the stock price 
almost 30% as expectations are either that he's   going to be making sweeping changes to the company 
or there's going to be a takeover eventually there   have been some discussions about the price point 
that he would have to buy the company based off   of the share price but either way the investors 
like the idea of it because it means changes to   the company and the way things have been going you 
really need changes just a couple weeks later in   October Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) and Microsoft 
Stock (MSFT Stock) announced a multi-year   partnership and I’m still kind of baffled to 
why Microsoft Stock (MSFT Stock) really did   this so in the deal Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) 
we'll use Microsoft Stock (MSFT Stock)'s tech   devices and software in their stores and we'll 
be pushing additional Xbox products in exchange   Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) will get a percentage 
of all digital sales from consoles bought at the   physical Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) locations 
and so this is huge because as I mentioned the   switch that we've been seeing in the gaming market 
has been the switch to digital transactions and   this has really suffocated Gamestop Stock 
(GME Stock) because this is not a means   that they're able to sell their products 
and so while we don't know exactly what   the numbers of this deal are I’m going 
to put that graphic back up from 2018   this is a huge deal for Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) 
and so this was one of the reasons why the stock   price shot up significantly and then the most 
recent news was just this past week was Ryan   Cohen upped his stake to 13% and then Gamestop 
Stock (GME Stock) shot up 30% from that news.   I want to talk about something that has 
been pushing Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) up   a pretty good amount in the past couple months 
and it is yes the positivity from the news but   one of the most interesting parts of investing in 
the stock market in 2020 has been the influence   of wall street bets and so the wall street bets 
are wsb is a subreddit that I’ve been following   for a couple years now as a lurker just because 
I do enjoy investing in the stock market and I   like seeing people that take maybe more risky 
positions and have huge payouts so the idea of   wall street bets is that most people are taking 
huge gambles on buying options with very short   expiration dates way out of the money to 
try to get huge profits and so it's very   common to see people posting how they've lost 
most of their account in just a couple trades   or it's common to see like this guy that made 
more than a thousand percent gain in a single year   and then you have the other group of people on 
wall street bets which includes myself called   theta gang the idea behind theta gang is that 
you're selling the options to these people that   are willing to pay you know ridiculous uh premiums 
for pretty much worthless options and so someone   like myself I love the wheel strategy and the 
reason behind it is I’m able to pocket premiums   reliably and I’m not going to have that 
you know a thousand percent increase in   my portfolio in a single year but I’m 
not going to blow up my account so   those are the two people that are kind of 
competing for profits on wall street bets but   this is a subreddit that commonly rallies behind 
very volatile stocks and I’m going to be talking   about more of these stocks later on this week 
but Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) has been one of   the top dogs recently I found this website that 
categorizes each post made on wall street bets   and a bullish or bearish sentiment based off of 
the words that they use and then ranks them by   popularity and here's the graphic for what that 
looks like right now and as you can see wall   street bets is a very bullish group of people wall 
street bets is unified around the goal of waiting   out the short sellers on Gamestop Stock (GME 
Stock) currently shorting stock means that you   borrow the shares of a company from your broker 
with the expectation that you'll pay them back in   the future with the same shares of that company 
plus a little bit of interest and so the broker   just wants the shares back eventually it doesn't 
matter what price you give it back to them at   the whole point is you want to borrow the 
shares from your broker sell them for cash and   then eventually buy them back at a later date at a 
lower price and you're able to keep the difference   in those two prices but the idea is that you can't 
hold on to these shares forever because it is the   expectation that you're going to have to give them 
back you're paying extra money to your broker for   owning these shares and if it's going the wrong 
direction you're not going to hold this forever   and so this is a very important distinction 
between buying puts and shorting a stock say I   buy a fifteen dollar put on Gamestop Stock (GME 
Stock) and the stock tanks down to ten dollars   that put means that I’m able to sell it to someone 
for fifteen dollars instead of the ten dollars   that it's available on the overall market but the 
distinction between the two of them is that if say   Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) stays high I don't have 
to sell at 15 if I don't want to it wouldn't make   sense for me to sell my shares below the current 
market price and so the distinction is with a   short seller you're required to buy those shares 
back eventually whereas if the stock continues to   go up and I bought my put I can just let it expire 
worthless and nothing happens and so the result of   this is that you're eventually going to have to 
close out your position and buy those shares back   and if a lot of people do that at a single time 
it results in a short squeeze which is what the   people on wall street bets are trying to wait for 
at this point so usually just an example b person   a goes out to close out their position has to 
buy the shares back that stock gets pushed up   in price because the buying pressure increases 
person b sees that they're losing out on more   money and does the same thing it's usually 
a rush to try to get out of your position   as the stock price increases rapidly and normally 
we see like a 20 30 40 percent move because   depending on how big the short interest is on 
a stock it can be in a very aggressive move   and so as you can see right now the short interest 
on Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) is pretty high   and it's been that way for a long time meaning 
that a short squeeze is likely going to happen   eventually as the stock price continues to go 
up and so we've seen a couple of short squeezes   this year the most famous being with Tesla Stock 
(TSLA Stock) Tesla Stock (TSLA Stock) was one of   the most shorted stocks of all time and this year 
with its meteoric rise being up over 600 percent   at this point Tesla Stock (TSLA Stock) short 
sellers have lost more money than the entire   airline industry which is crazy to think about 
so it's going to be very interesting to watch I   do have a position on Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) 
right now and I will share that in my video this   week talking about my current portfolio but 
now I want to make a bull and a bear case for   Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) because I think it's 
important to hear both sides of the argument   I am going to start with the bowl case because 
I think that's what most people want to hear   and the biggest thing for the short term has to 
do with momentum this is a stock that's been on   a tear and a short squeeze is looking more and 
more likely the higher the price increases over   time given that potential of a short squeeze the 
upside potential for the short term is crazy I’ve   seen some people saying that the upside is like 
40 dollars I’ve been seeing that sometimes the   upside is 60 and so there's a lot of positive for 
a short term potential also especially since we're   getting towards the end of the year I think it's 
pretty likely that we're going to see this happen   potentially by the end of the week as some people 
that are shorting the stock may try to close out   their positions to take the tax loss as that 
is a very interesting strategy that people   are trying to minimize their tax bill and for a 
stock like game stop that has been going up for   the past couple months there's probably a lot of 
people that are sitting on some huge losses there   another bold case comes from the history of 
Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) here's a graphic that   overlays the release of each of the video game 
consoles over the past decade plus any time that   a major console has been released the stock price 
is shot up and now that we've recently had the   release of the new Xbox and the ps5 it's possible 
that we're going to see a very similar thing   and then the final bull case that I can think 
of is that wall street bets is a powerful group   even though many people don't really want 
to acknowledge it they all trade in the   same direction even though it's not a massive 
amount of money that each person is trading with   it's the sheer number of people and the fact 
that they're all trading in the same direction   when I say that the trend is your friend the 
direction of people trading is also a trend   that you need to take advantage of and kind 
of follow and so since all these people are   very bullish on Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) 
that is a major force it is kind of like   the equivalent of a mutual fund being bullish 
on a stock put all the money together it might   not reach the same amount of money for each 
transaction that we see with a mutual fund but   it is a huge amount of money it's all going in 
the same direction so next I want to talk about   the bear cases and the first and main one is that 
Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) is still in a really   tough spot the news from Ryan Cohen wanting 
to compete with amazon is a really cute idea   but I don't see it as being very close to being an 
actual thing at this point they still have over 5   500 locations and that's way too much considering 
the physical retailers are really struggling   digital is the future and that graphic that 
I showed about sales from the digital means   meaning that Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) is 
getting less and less of each of the actual   video game sales in this industry that's going 
to explode with the recent release of these new   generation consoles and while the Xbox deal sounds 
great I don't think it's going to be as great as   maybe some people kind of expect it to be it is 
sure going to be a positive for the company but   we really don't know the numbers yet and I don't 
think it's going to be enough to save the company   Xbox was lagging in the last console cycle and 
here's how console sales have been looking in   the past couple years with Xbox really lagging 
behind Nintendo and Sony in the last generation so   we don't know the numbers for the next generation 
Xbox but it's going to be interesting to see how   it looks because that deal with Xbox sounds great 
but we really don't know the numbers behind it   and then finally I don't like the management group 
when it comes to Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) he's   been a company that's never really been 
innovative they had the opportunity to buy   twitch the streaming service but they backed 
out of it and amazon ended up buying it and   they're going to have to reinvent themselves if 
they want to survive Ryan Cohen makes that look   possible with his track record with e-commerce 
with Chewy Stock (CHWY Stock) but it's still a   huge challenge and there's a lot of hurdles 
to go through and probably a lot of growing   pains to make this a successful long-term 
investment so overall there's some bullish   cases or some bearish cases for the short term 
I’m pretty bullish long-term decently bearish   and I will talk about the position that I took 
this morning on Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) it's   going to be a very short position it's going 
to expire in three days uh but yeah I thought   this was an interesting topic I wanted to 
talk about the power of wall street bets   talk about Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) the examples 
that we've seen with the momentum being pushed by   wall street bets with an example like Tesla 
Stock (TSLA Stock) and the short sellers   because I think this was a very interesting 
narrative and I’m very curious to see what's   going to happen at Gamestop Stock (GME Stock) in 
the upcoming months maybe as the momentum finally   slows down so thanks for watching I appreciate all 
the support and I will see you in the next video",GME,"['hey', 'guys', 'how', 's', 'it', 'going', 'it', 's', 'Andy', 'from', 'magoo', 'investing', 'and', 'happy', 'Monday', 'we', 'finally', 'made',

47,kNZHJQiNbvc," Oh boy what a day! Hi traders! Thank you for joining. I'm about to show 
you my best day ever. I've been trading for 21   years and I've never had a day like that that's all 
thanks to GME; now take a look at what happened   to GME. This stock started today at $260  
and look at the way it's just moving up that's the   first few minutes of the trading session. I got 
prepared for this trade. I knew pre-market time  that something big is going to happen to GME, well 
actually I thought I knew that for the past three   days and it did not happen, so I'm still waiting 
and today I came up with a plan which was a very,   very extreme plan. I was planning on a one million 
dollar trade and I knew that I'm risking one   million dollars. Now take a look at the daily of 
GME to understand why I'm doing that. This stock   was at $19 just recently moved up over $450 just 
yesterday and the way it started today with a big   move up after a big gap down - that indicates just 
one thing; there still is short sellers who are   being squeezed out of this stock and this has to be 
stopped sometime and I'm about to take advantage   of that. So I'm planning a trade in GME and I did 
announce in my trading room today that    I have a target which is around $200 and I'm 
expecting the stock to come down, I did not expect   it to come down today. I did say that it's gonna 
take probably a few days, maybe two or three days,   I didn't know how long, but this time I'm going 
to hang on and just you know take the heat. Now   take a look at the point where I started 
selling that's the point where I'm about   to short 4,000 shares right now because it moved 
down from the highs, well I was wrong. I did   have a stop loss my stop-loss was not a technical 
stop-loss because I stopped trusting GME recently.   I stopped trusting the technicals in GME recently 
because I just learned from the past few days that   well it's a short squeeze it doesn't have to work 
according to the known technical rules now look at   this point I'm down two hundred thousand dollars 
and remember my stop is one million dollars, which   is approximately half of what I earned last year. 
Now four hundred dollars down,   five hundred thousand dollars down and that was it. 
Now GME started to come down you're seeing   it being halted several times that's one of 
them because when stock is coming down a lot   it's being halted it's being stopped now it 
resumes and it starts trending lower now it's   getting to be a little bit more clear. Now I'm 
understanding that that would probably be it   and at that point right now it crashed I missed 
that point really because I wanted to add right   there under $400, in fact Scott in the trading room, 
he just shorted it at $400 now it pops up again   and I'm getting ready to add another 2,000 shares 
because I like the trend right now. It looks to me   like it's failing now it's hard to see because 
it's a fast forward here but you need to take a   look at the buyers and the sellers to understand 
why I thought there will be a pressure now I'm   about to add another 2,000 shares and look at the 
way it just comes down now very nice technical   formation here fall short and at that point,  
again halted, so I will wait again until it resumes   here it goes again it resumes. Added two thousand 
shares. Now traders if you like this video so far   how about giving us a thumb up it's right here 
that button it helps our channel helps more people   like you who are interested in trading so we will 
really appreciate that. Now let's take a look at    what continues to happen here today in GME now I 
just want to remind you, my target was around $200,   $250, but that was not an intraday target. I knew 
I'm getting into this trade for several days.    I was surprised. I was surprised. Now here it is being 
halted again. Now at that point it's quite clear   to understand that the stock is coming down, look 
at what happens right when it opened; just moved in,   halted again and again when it's going to open you're 
going see a lot of sellers coming in and look at   how it goes I'm up four hundred thousand dollars, 
five hundred thousand dollars and again it's being   halted as you can see here several times as it 
came down now look at the way it just crashes down   and that's the time where really it's starting to go 
back to its senses. Another crash right over here   and at that point again halted. Look at the results 
here I'm up 1.2 million dollars. Taking my profits   right here. Moved out of the trade. You see the 
price is around $140 I was really planning for $200.   In fact, I was saying to myself that if it only 
comes down to 250 dollars intraday I would   take it. Now take a look at the results over here 
I had several trades today that's not my only   trade but definitely my best trade ever up 1.278 
million dollars. Well, I've never had the trade like   that and I hope you enjoyed this trade and if

48,1T1Y7Jljjfk," if you have a stake in one of these talks that has 
gone crazy these past few days like gme and amc   and not in a good way today i can explain exactly 
what's going on from a data scientist point of   view right now as of every second gme is currently 
hovering around a hundred dollars let's see the   real-time volatility in the corner right down 
there i'm going to keep it right there as we have   this video as we talk through let's just see how 
much it fluctuates in the video put out yesterday   it talked about exactly what shorting a stock 
is how hedge funds have overshored a specific   stock called gme gamestop and now what a bunch of 
people are doing to prevent the hedge funds from   benefiting once again from bankrupting something 
that is probably akin to a lot of the cornerstones   of your childhood going to games up as a kid 
hanging out there and now that it took care of   us in our childhood it's time for us to take care 
of it but why did it suddenly fall up to 5 billion   in valuation in just one hour well let me explain 
exactly why with this chart right here how to   take down five billion dollars of valuation in one 
hour with just 250 million dollars you see each of   these dips in the morning of today a couple hours 
ago was an institutional attack selling many many   shares one after another pretending as if this is 
investor behavior but it's actually manipulation   we see that hedge funds and other institutions 
are taking their shares selling them in batches   so that it seems like it is panic selling from a 
lot of different individual investors trading bot   algorithms get scared and it plummets the price 
down and with you your attendees along with it   it's important to know that regular investors 
are not selling this is not indicative of the   actual behavior of the market and one of the 
most important things to note is that you are   still being restricted on how many shares you 
can buy why do you think that they'll be putting   these restrictions on robinhood and other trading 
applications if it wasn't for the fact that they   are scared they are scared that this attack is 
not going to convince enough individual investors   to pull out remember the fund widget i had of 
how much profit there would be if the price goes   up and down for the hedge fund well that is just 
unrealized loss when you sell you actually realize   it and make it into fruition the truth of the 
matter is these shorts still are out there these   dogs with their treats on their noses are still 
out there and these hedge funds have not settled   these shorts quite yet so since these shorts 
exist the amount of interest needed to be paid   is going to keep rising millions of dollars a day 
and these hedge funds are not going to be able   to hold out for much longer right before i 
give my final analysis of what you should do   with this information i want to show you guys 
a picture of the 2008 volkswagen squeeze you   are right here right at the bottom of the 
squeeze it is always darkest before the dawn   it is always going to be larger players trying to 
manipulate the smaller players right now you and   me we're the smaller players but if enough of 
us hold or hodl we will make it to the moon so   my final analysis is there are people holding just 
like you and me and they are not being manipulated   by the ups and downs of a market mainly 
traded by bots and coordinated attacks   if you have the ability to buy it might not be a 
bad idea to buy the dip but of course once again   this is not financial advice this is just for 
entertainment as for those of you who have not yet   gone in and have therefore fewer restrictions on 
how many shares you can buy i have a weeble link   right down below that you can get four free 
stocks maybe one of them is going to be gme   if you sign up and add a hundred dollars 
as well as and i hate to say it robin hood   still exists as a stock option if you 
wanted to get a free stock on robin hood   that has a lot fewer restrictions you could just 
put a dollar in and you get your free stock there   stay safe don't do anything crazy and 
remember this unrealized loss doesn't   exist doesn't actualize doesn't materialize 
until you press the sell button so don't be   caught at the bottom of the dip right before the 
rise as always i'll see you guys next time peace you",GME,"['if', 'you', 'have', 'a', 'stake', 'in', 'one', 'of', 'these', 'talks', 'that', 'has', 'gone', 'crazy', 'these', 'past', 'few', 'days',

49,wUQeuxkmcAY," what's up everyone brad here from the money 
dad channel in this video i want to talk about   gamestop ticker gme because this stock just 
absolutely dominated the stock market today   looking at the uh volume for the day this is the 
all us exchanges volume leaders so the most shares   traded on the day gamestop was number two they 
are not normally on this list whatsoever and   they absolutely dominated not only did they have 
the second most shares traded they also were up 57   at the close which was a pretty big retracement 
off of the highs i mean they were way up there   at one point i want to say i don't remember 
exactly but they were something like 70 or 80   or even 90 percent up on the day so so gamestop 
from a technical perspective had a crazy good day   now let's take a look at what bar chart says on 
the technicals alright so looking over here real   quick barchart.com says their technical opinion 
rating is a 100 percent buy and ranks in the top   one percent of all short-term signal directions 
long-term indicators fully support a continuation   of the trend okay i had a feeling they were going 
to say that but i wasn't quite sure that's the   honestly the first time i had clicked on that 
uh right now as i'm recording this uh honest to   god truth so i wasn't positive but i had a feeling 
just because this is such a strong move they had a   massive update on a massive volume day so 
that's something that you really love to see   but uh that wasn't really like the only good thing 
that we've seen out of gamestop in a long time and   that's really what i want to make this video 
about is look honestly like today put gamestop   on my radar but i went and looked at their chart 
because of today and i'm making this video because   i like what i see on the chart for the year for 
the last uh trailing 12 months anyway so that's   what i want to show you guys and i know gamestop 
is going to be on a lot of people's radar now and   it was probably on a good chunk of people's radars 
you know through 2020 as a pandemic play you   know everybody's staying at home they're playing 
more video games they're buying more video games   video games things like that but today was 
such a massive move that it's going to be on   everybody's radar right so i wanted to make this 
video to kind of look at the chart for the entire   uh last 12 months or 12 months plus really and 
give you guys an idea of what's going on with this   stock because it really looks good honestly so you 
can see all the way back here this was the pandem   this was when the pandemic hit the united states 
we had our march lows and then that v-shaped   recovery with a lot of the big tech stocks the 
stay at home stocks things like that we had a   massive v-shape recovery right a lot of stocks 
did not recover like that but anything that   had anything to do with stay at home had a pretty 
quick recovery right so gamestop right their main   business is we sell video games right everybody's 
staying at home to play more video games   they had a massive uh quick recovery so you get 
that quick recovery you start trailing off because   there's just less hype around the stock in the 
same time we think you know we're probably gonna   get back to a normal life soon and then they start 
to turn around and start heading up again because   man right around this time july august time frame 
we start to see increased infection numbers right   it's kind of like second wave is coming around 
let's look at some of these moves i'm going to   zoom in a little bit over here because this is 
where we start to see some real price action and   i want to look at the volume that is coinciding 
with price action because that's the real story   here look at every time this stock makes a move 
up what does it coincide with a big volume move   right so you've got this little trickle up and 
then boom shoot to the upside with a big volume   move and then what happens after that volume just 
dies off right so you have this consolidation   phase until the market can kind of recoup and get 
more interest in the stock and then what happens   boom another big update on increased volume right 
and then we're consolidating consolidating and   what happens boom big update on big volume and 
then we consolidate right big consolidation phase   right here not a whole lot of volume maybe 
a little volume spike right here maybe that   was a news event not quite sure but look what 
happens here we have this big up day right here   on increased volume and then just insane 
volume today on a massive update look this   has been happening in this stock since september 
it's not hard to see what is happening here   gamestop is in a clear uptrend this is obvious at 
this point right and the volume is really telling   the story here guys i mean this is so obvious 
at this point we're seeing volume coincide   with these big moves this is what you want 
to see from a technical indicator and this   is why gamestop this is what i get and this is 
why bar chart is putting this 100 buy rating   in the top one percent of all short-term 
signal directions on this stock it's because   the technicals look fantastic on this chart 
it's moving up it's moving up on strong   volume pushes and then consolidation phases these 
are very healthy moves for a stock okay this is   not some giant parabolic move this is just healthy 
uptrend with consolidation phase on low volume   and then healthy uptrend on big volume followed 
by consolidation phase with low volume i mean   this is how you want to see a stock move this is 
a good looking stock chart okay trending up at a   pretty steep level but you still have these 
consolidation phases that you really need to see   to have a healthy uptrend right it's not 
going straight up right because that i mean   it's not like some parabolic move but it's still 
going up pretty hard it's going up pretty hard   but it still has consolidation phases so it 
looks really good for gamestop right here um i   i do like this company going forward you know 
what i was not a big fan of gamestop about a   year ago i just didn't understand how the business 
model was going to succeed going forward you know   people i mean it almost felt like the video game 
version of blockbuster right blockbuster went   bankrupt when the online movie watching 
era started to uh come around right um   video streaming movie streaming 
that put blockbuster out of business   well so i don't understand 
gamestop where you know you have to   physically walk into their store to buy a game or 
trade a game or sell your game when all of these   transactions can now take place online right 
it's the same concept as blockbuster going out of   business because people are not walking into their 
store anymore they are buying movies online or   they're they you know at the time they were going 
red box or whatever the equivalent was at the time   um so i didn't like gamestop that much back you 
know a year ago but what this chart is telling me   is that gamestop is thriving right now absolutely 
so with their stock going up like this it's   possible that they can leverage this situation 
to use the capital that they have to expand their   business or evolve their business into something 
that is uh better suited for the modern age   okay so that that's more of a fundamental uh 
talk point but from a technical standpoint   from my perspective and bar chart.com perspective 
this chart looks very good very bullish going   forward even with this big old spike look um i 
don't know that i would buy this stock today just   because if you look at every other rally there's 
a nice little consolidation phase that comes right   after these rallies right so we have a massive 
rally it retraced a little bit off the off the   off the top of the candlestick we have a pretty 
big wick so we're probably going to have a nice   little consolidation phase but what happens after 
every single consolidation phase on this chart   you go you end up going up again at some point 
right it's like these little uh bull flags both   like both like not quite bull flags but 
their consolidation periods nonetheless   so gamestop looks good for the medium to 
long term i think in my opinion anyway   short term i think we're going to consolidate 
probably going to lose a little bit   right it's going to be this sideways to slightly 
downward action on gamestop in the short term   in my opinion but eventually i think the way 
is up so gamestop looks pretty good that's what   i've got for it if you guys enjoyed this video

50,LIcp-Q2wYHs," Welcome back to the watch list. I'm Tom White filling in for Nicole Petallides YY's Let's welcome in our next guest, and that's Dan IVZ he's a managing director in equity research at Wedbush. Welcome to show Dan Appreciate it. Now I just received your new note this morning like I wanted to hit on that before we get into Tesla's here a little bit, but it's pretty positive and I think it's going against the grain here a little bit with what we've seen as far as the market moves this year, with the nasty lagging that the other three major indices, you're looking at 25 to 30% Growth. Maybe in that text based give me a run down here in the note. Yeah Good. I believe this pullback that we've seen rotation trade maniacal focus on the 10 Year. It's created would I've used a golden opportunity in terms of the in the secular winners. We believe tech stocks up another 25-30 percent from here. NASDAQ's 16,000. In cloud inside security and five G and I believe one of you in terms of earnings. That's gonna be a major catalyst the tax base. Toso to me. This is really the opportunity to own Secular winners across clouds, cybersecurity in five Jean look, the heaters AR gonna heat if he had the rather tech rally many of them in here the last 3 to 4 years. We continue thing. This is a blip. Rather than the star veteran. Yeah and I think those that rising interest rate environment that has everybody spooked a little bit on this sector as the 10 year yield kind of stabilizes here, You're gonna get these sectors to get more comfortable at these levels as far as the Growth name goes, and we've seen a little bit of movement back into those names. Now you had a couple big names in their with Apple and my krose, along with nuance. Give me the breakdown here an apple because you're expecting a few more iPhones to sell here, Dan Yeah, I mean, the super cycle thesis we've talked about, you know, it's playing out and we've seen across our agent checks. I think March quarter is gonna be Rebus. I think on a trajectory right now. BBA TENSION 242 150 million units Bride wants would beat the record from 2005 with iPhone six. This isn't this is not just a one year cycle. There's a two year cycle going into IVZ 13 as well. 40.7 base is and when they're buy prepared, doctor that combined with the rearing on service. I think a year from now we're looking at $3 trillion mark happen. Apple Yeah, Go to Microsoft. Go ahead. Go ahead, Dan. But but just you're going in the themes. Five geezer APPLETINI, You'll get cloud. Only 35 of the way through on the cloud ship Microsoft has seemed more and more share gains for exams on actually accelerated as your Growth. I believe this is going to be another game changer quarter. Which is why we love that There are third topic is nuance, healthcare Cloud play, re reading in process, I think right now called a loo $40 stock. I think this is a senior citizen. Stock and neck 6-9 months, and we got those price target upside thinking APPLETINI, 75 and Microsoft 2-3 100 s O pretty optimistic going into the end of the year. We'll have to wait and see on those key. One Those earnings that are coming up here at the end of the month, but I don't want to switch back to Tesler now, Dan, because we did have that upgrade that you that you gave earlier this week, $2000 a share your say that China's booming right now What do your estimates here for? Tesla's the evey, although it's a small component of the auto sales, it's growing at a rapid pace here. Get the green tidal wave and I think we're seeing that kicked off last week in the US. With Baden. But if you look at China that that's the linchpin to the both pieces for testimony seeing skyrocket sounds. In China that could be 40 overall go into next year. Combine that with what we're seeing is green tidal wave in Europe in the U. S. Only 3% of automobiles that AR evey Today we think going 10% next 3 to 4 years, and it's not just hassle. GM through the whole ACWI assistant is being built out, But we believe when I look a task, given deliveries and given where we see numbers when you look out, and there's$1000 stock by the end of this year. Yeah. And if you look at that competition, it is starting to heat up, especially over in Europe. Where you know Audi and some of the other names Volkswagen or are certain to ramp up a little bit there. But if you look at, um you know the competition. You know, it's there for the taking, because the space is growing right? And the new Administracion has his green agenda. What do your expectations for the benefits to not only, you know the E V space, but Tesla in general. Yeah I think that that's something that I still don't think is as appreciate and I think in terms of what's happening in the U. S 7500 credits there capped out in terms of passing GM. 2 200,000 ceiling, I think, as part of this infrastructure bill that that gets removed ceiling to do is get restored for passengers and, of course, bring one buying those cars now that was credits care for story, which I think is significant in the U. S. As well as we believe 10-30 $1000 is what we're hearing could be the pride the next level of tax credits, and that's significant because us is wag behind Europe in China. 2% on Lian terms of evey sows, I believe this is some miss come in leg, not just a Tesla. But to the overall ADV eco system. We believe Warren have trillion of the five trillion In evey of next decades. Coming in the U. S. So eco systems gonna be built out? Yeah, And you mentioned that eco system is the fact that Biden his Administracion, one of their key components of this green agenda is getting more charging station and that's always been a concern. As far as the BEVGS space goes, But what's down the road for Tesla? What's next catalyst? Is it going to be the truck? Is it going to be the semi space that could, you know? Maybe propel the stock even higher? Yeah. Then there's two specific cattle is one. I think we're just ultimately as we go through next few quarters numbers that could be the street by 10 15% I think is that plays out That gets full EEM or digesting the stock, But in terms of the drum roll it cyber trunk. I mean, we think we're starting to get too close to 700,000 pre orders. That's gonna be the next leg along with what we're seeing a model. Why models? Essen at this point is noise. Your see some headway on that. And then you take a step back gold age AVVAA, and I think we're looking at houses $1000",AAPL,"['Welcome', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'watch', 'list', 'I', 'm', 'Tom', 'White', 'filling', 'in', 'for',

51,TMIS0vdfAeM," so do i buy more apple or am i going 
to sell am i buying or am i selling   this is a big decision well welcome back to the 
sweet lifers yes this community right here we call   ourselves sweet lifers thanks to the community 
poll that's what you guys voted on and that's   what we shall call ourselves and sweet lifers are 
all about living your ultimate desired sweet life   through smart money management and personal 
finance tips and tricks that we share on this   channel every day so if you're not a sweet lifer 
become one right now subscribe today but we're   going to talk about warren buffett and all of a 
sudden his pivot and his sale of a ton of shares   of apple stock why is he doing that and if you 
are either one thinking about buying apple stock   or two you hold a position in apple and you're 
wondering should i also get out of my position   in apple and sell some of the shares we're gonna 
break it all down today let's get started with   this first we gotta talk about warren buffett for 
a second warren buffett of course this guy that is   probably one of he's either the first or second 
or third or fourth something like he's in the   top five wealthiest people in the world according 
to forbes magazine with an estimated fortune of   about 80 billion dollars hold on a second i can't 
fathom that 80 billion dollars and the best part   about this guys this guy is not driving around in 
a lambo you think you know he obviously can afford   a few lambos if he wanted to he could be rolling 
with he could just be living the dream guys but   he's not he's actually very conservative i think 
if i remember correctly he drives like a buick and   he like buys like hand-me-down type of clothes 
he's not one of those guys that blows his cash   he might be onto something there about how to get 
rich without just looking rich but anyway billion   80 bill boom boom my mind is blown 80 billion okay 
i gotta move on from that okay so warren buffett   he's selling apple but does that mean 
that you should bet against apple as well   does that mean that we're in for some type of 
crisis with apple is he seeing something that   we're not these big tech companies are starting to 
drop as of early march 2021 that's the recording   of this video so if we look at things like the 
tesla if we look at things like apple and neo   and things like that they're going down because 
they're thinking that there's like this big tech   sell-off what's that mean for the future though 
and why is he doing that warren buffett has talked   about apple so much he has promoted apple so much 
he has bought so many shares in the past of apple   what's with the pivot what do we need to know 
let's start off with question of the day today's   question of the day i want to know where you think 
sweet lifers where you think apple's going to go   where is this stock going to continue to go up 
do you think we're in a correction period where   it's just going to stagnate for a while and just 
kind of plateau for a little while before the   next innovation or do you think this is just a 
small dip and it's about to go to the moon what   do you think comment down below actually i was 
asking just the other day on the community tab   what you thought of tesla you can see the results 
right here obviously a lot of people think that   this is a short term thing for tesla and tesla is 
going to bounce back and go to the moon as well   but i want to know about apple so drop me a 
line down below i'm interested to see what   your thoughts are very first thing i want 
to say though so i want to comfort my ipad   it's going to be okay people still 
love you people still care about you   all jokes aside i don't think we should bet 
against apple just yet we got to look at the   history of apple and i think it's important to 
look at the history so we can be smarter about   the future of where apple is going and then 
we can kind of dig into really understanding   why warren buffett may be selling some of these 
things and i'm going to let you know exactly what   i'm doing with my shares of apple as well as my 
future position within apple stock specifically   so let's break it down you may remember for 
those of you that actually probably half   of you probably weren't even born around this 
time i can sit here and feel old for a second   okay so steve jobs he leaves apple in 1985-ish 
and he separates from apple for quite a long   period of time in that period of time between 
1985 and 1997-ish steve jobs isn't part of apple   and apple becomes a kind of this boring company 
all of a sudden you're seeing like windows and   microsoft kind of take the market of personal 
computers you see a lot of ibm coming into the   computer market a lot of people are running 
for like the best thing oh windows 95 windows   98 windows 2000 there was so much hype around 
windows and apple was just this like clunky mac   mcintosh computer thing and it was kind of boring 
but then steve jobs comes back into the picture   he joins apple once again in about 1997 1998 
and all of a sudden things start looking a lot   better for apple i think steve jobs was really 
the godfather of apple's success not just in   the history of it but also in the future to come 
even though steve jobs isn't with us today anymore   i think he's set up now a golden road for apple 
to follow but here's where it gets interesting   in 2007 he invents of course what we most of 
us all have and that's the iphone he invents   the iphone and it's a complete game changer for 
the market not just in computing but also now in   telephones and cell phones and things like that 
here we go we flash forward they come out with   innovation after innovation you got the watch you 
got the ipad you got the mac and a much better mac   that's like kicking ass and taking names a lot 
of people now look at apple as that exquisite   high-end sophisticated all-inclusive way to make 
your life more convenient that's the history of   apple one thing we want to do when we look into 
stocks when i look into should i buy more should   i sell should i hold is i'm also looking at 
what is this company doing it's not just about   looking around the neighborhood and seeing how 
many people are starting to buy apple products   that's only a very small piece of the pie for 
me when it comes down to really getting excited   about a company sure their sales are going great 
they're a very stable company that's wonderful   but what does the future be hold what are they 
innovating what's the next big thing that's what's   going to help continue a very strong i think 
growth record for a stock for a company and   here's what's going on with apple early 2021 guys 
i you know early 2021 it was like january february   all of a sudden this news breaks about an apple 
car an apple car coming out and i'm betting for   the apple car i'm putting i'm going all in on this 
apple car i think apple car is gonna be something   to behold because i think apple wants to go 
against tesla and some of these other ones and   come up with their own innovation in an area and 
a market that they quite haven't tapped into yet   and this rumor was talking about their partnership 
with hyundai i think it was you know the maker of   kia then all of a sudden it was kind of like no 
no we're not working with kia we're not doing   anything like that who knows maybe they are maybe 
they aren't maybe they're working with like ford   or gm we don't know yet around california very 
close to the apple headquarters there has been   sightings of prototype vehicles that are aiming 
to try to self-drive themselves in an electric   vehicle format that they are tying to a prototype 
that apple is testing so here we go we got   vehicles on the road from apple i think they're 
innovating guys and i think it's something we need   to keep an eye on one thing they haven't tapped 
into yet is how we get from point a to point b   having a car in that arsenal gives us the 
opportunity now to get in a car and get excited   about going to work and having siri drive us there 
siri take me to work okay boomer and off she'll   go guys and off she'll go i'd even go as far to 
say that i think that because of what apple has   done outside of the car but what i was mentioning 
earlier is now they're taking the space of the ibm   and the microsoft i see so many people now 
transitioning from the windows platform to   the mac platform i'm one of them myself i've 
owned a windows computer since 1997. i was a   kid that i'm not that old guy so i'm not that old 
but or maybe i am i don't know how old are you   but this past year i just i got a mac and i've 
never looked back this thing is powerful it makes   things happen so i wouldn't bet against apple i 
think they have a lot more to come apple's strong   financial performance over the last decade few 
companies have managed to grow revenue or free   cash flow so quickly and consistently look at 
that 2010 65 billion up to 294 billion of revenue   in quarter one at 2021 the free cash flow going 
from 16.6 billion dollars to 80.2 billion dollars   and the return on invested capital this is right 
here all about the innovation i was talking about   earlier was 34 in its last fiscal quarter meaning 
the company earned 34 cents for every one dollar   invested in the business that my friend is a smart 
company and by the way i got this from the motley   fool they have a great service where they can help 
you figure out the best ways to start investing if   you're a beginner or even if you're a little bit 
more immediate in advance i think it's a great way   to get your knowledge up on the stock market link 
down in the description below so let's get back   to the matter here why did buffett sell apple what 
am i doing with apple i want to start with a 1988   yeah now i'm really throwing it back guys 1988 
letter to the shareholders that warren buffett   put out and he said quote when we earn portions 
of outstanding businesses with outstanding   managements our favorite holding period is 
forever i believe apple checks both of those boxes   i just told you the financial performance of apple 
so if they have good management and they have a   good track record why would buffett sell shares 
in apple if you think about it warren buffett   has billions of dollars invested and if you look 
at his portfolio a lot of that comes from apple so   he already has a very large holding in apple and i 
think that's something that we need to think about   is that he earns 887 million shares of apple stock 
which today is worth more than 117 billion so if   you think about it he owns more than five percent 
of apple's outstanding shares and that is about 44   of buffets over our portfolio so he 
may be looking at that and saying okay   obviously he is that long-term billionaire 
investor right so he's not going to want to   put all of his eggs in one basket and the higher 
that percentage goes where all of a sudden half of   your portfolio potentially is tied up in just 
one company that could be very very dangerous   and so he is likely pulling back he did 
not sell all of his shares he still owns   a ton more shares than you and i do for sure 
for sure you know i mean he could sell 10 and   still kick our butt and take our names guys that's 
that's his positioning right now he he owns that   he has that power just because he's doing that 
does not mean he's betting against the company   and i think what's happening is some people saw 
that on the news oh god warren buffett is selling   i think i need to sell what he's doing is he's 
rebalancing he's being smart and not putting all   the eggs in one basket he still owns a ton he 
still loves apple but he's spreading that out   to be smart with his overall portfolio so here i 
am in my weeble portfolio by the way get yourself   a weeble portfolio and up to two free stocks

makes apple appealing in my mind and i hope   it gives you some insight on don't just go off 
of one person's actions don't just look at the   headline of a news and say warren buffett 
sells apple i need to do the same thing   be smart because remember you're a sweet lifer

52,-N-6Y_v9eNY," - $111.4 billion, yeah. Apple just posted their
holiday quarter results. And even now in the midst of peak, 2020/21 the cyber punk on last
generation consoles of years, Apple crushed it, and you
will not believe how hard. Sponsored by Ting. Real quick, YouTube shows only a small percentage
of you watching right now are actually subscribed. So if you like my videos, hit that button and we can build the biggest and the best community in tech together. The iPhone was up 17%, Apple
sold $65.6 billion of them. Now, it is important to remember that the iPhone shipped
later than usual last fall. So instead of initial surges
being in the previous quarter, all of it was in this
quarter, just all the surges. Same with the new M1 Max, but more on those in a
scorching hot minute. Prices on the base models were up, due to the more expensive components like Owlet and 5G modems. But the mix was also really high which means people who
bought into the iPhone 12, almost immediately often bought into the more expensive models like the 12 pro and the 12 pro max. Which to me, just highlights
how people keep insisting on reading the market wrong. Like I said, in my launch day review, it's not that everyone
is looking and saying, ""I can save a couple hundred bucks by not going for the pro."" It's more like they're
increasingly looking and saying, ""I can spend just a
couple hundred bucks more and get the pro."" More people just wanna feel like they've gotten the best value
price package per dollar. And that includes not
only what it can do now, but how long it will last doing it. Just how long it gets updates and even how high a
resale price it sustains. And yeah, still the cache. Which is why I think,
switchers were up as well, Meaning more people coming
to the iPhone from Android and upgraders were just way up meaning way more people
going from an older iPhone to an iPhone 12, who just found
now the right time to do it. And Tim Cook was also still
just all shades of bullish, because despite there now being over a billion iPhones
in our pockets, y'all, globally, there are still more people without iPhones than with iPhones. And he's looking at them,
maybe looking at you, and thinks he can still get
way more of that market, including you, especially
in places like India. And what's really fascinating here, is that Apple has built themselves up into an iPhone company sure, but now more than an iPhone company. In other words, they used the iPhone to build up everything else, so that when the iPhone isn't as strong everything else just picks up the slack. But when the iPhone comes back strong, everything else is still firing away and they just all become
a benevolent cycle, of force multipliers. Services are up 24% to $15.8 billion, driven by record performances in App Store, Music and
iCloud among others. And when you include everything the App Store gets a cut off, Apple hit 620 million paid subscribers, which given how many of us are spending all of our time in lockdown, just to me makes the kind of
sense that absolutely does. And in addition to the 1 billion iPhones Apple is almost 1.7 billion
devices in total inactive use. And that's just a huge
and still growing base to build more services on, like I said, a platform to build another
platform or several on. And that's also why, even
though Apple's margins just haven't really changed
since the Steve Jobs era, they're at the high-end right now, first, because that mix
towards a higher products I just mentioned, but also because more people are getting into more Apple services. And my guess is, Apple's hardware margins continue to get driven down by Apple continuing to invest
in more expensive components like Owlet and 5G. But services margins are just
more than making up for that, allowing Apple to continue to make those hardware investments without eating into any
ancillary product profits or simply running on empty, like some other companies seem to feel they have no choice but to do. The iPad was up a whopping
41% to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing work
and school from home reality, that so many of us have been
facing for just so long now. But also the new iPad Air and the entry-level iPad
updates were compelling. And like I said, ""Well I think a lot of
people who cover Apple still fail to realize the
difference between cost and value, it seems like consumers are
continuing to understand that even better and better now."" But what's really really remarkable here is that around half
the people buying iPads were still first-time iPad
buyers, despite the tablet market essentially continuing
to be an iPad market. And I think that goes
back to work from home, but also to how just how
badly most competitors continue to execute on tablets, especially in terms of software
and ecosystem integration. Which is a strength Apple
just keep showing over and over and over again with the iPad. Now, frustratingly, Apple lumps
Watch, Air Pods, Home Pods and all the extras into the same category. So competitors just can't easily see how well any one of them
is doing at any given time. But taken together they
were up 30% to $13 billion and he ludicrous, ludicrous,
75% of Apple Watch customers were first-time watch buyers. I say ludicrous so repetitively
because like the iPad the Apple Watch essentially
owns its market. But that market is
pretty much the opposite of the phone market right now, in that not many people have smartwatches. And so it's just wide wide
open with tons of room to run, especially for products
like the lower priced but just feature packed, Apple Watch SE and I wonder if Apple
is going to double down, as in price down on the SE this year to get even more people into the watch and then to services like Fitness+. The Mac was up 21% to $8.7 billion which doesn't really take a mentat to figure it had a lot to
do with the release of M1. That's Apple's first custom silicon for the MacBook Air,
entry level MacBook Pro, and then you base model, Silver Mac Mini. Around half the people buying Macs were first-time Mac buyers as well. And since Apple still has only a tiny, tiny share of the PC market, there is just tons and tons of room for more growth there as well. Especially as the next
set of Apple Silicon Macs start coming out, the
higher end pros and IMAX, and over the next few
generations of just all of them. In other words, dear Legacy PC users, and you know who you are, Apple thinks the combination of industry
leading performance, experience and battery life are going to prove just
way, way, way, way, just absolutely quad way too compelling for you to ignore. Much like the savings

53,fm7NvMYB-Mg," (typing) (thunking) (typing) (thunking) (typing) - Hi friends! When we
pick a stock to invest, we take our hard earned
money, the money that we use our time, our sweat, and our effort and after that we take our money that we earn, and pick a stock. Is it fair to be extremely
choosy and strict when we pick a stock? I don't understand how some people can pick a stock because of some
good rumor, or some good news. It's really important
to pick the right stock, the right stock that fits
your investment style. Look, in this video I'm not bashing Apple. In fact, Apple made me
lots of money previously. I'm using a 16-inch MacBook
Pro, the base model, an iPhone, AirPods Pro! Here! Apple makes the best products,
and they are amazing! Simple to use, and reliable. So, in this video I will
explain Apple's business model. Apple is getting ready
the business for a total sheath in profit making,
the stock is supposed to rise, and rise by a lot. But I'm still not investing in Apple! I still prefer to buy Tesla stock. Anyway, appreciate the thumbs up, it really helps a lot in
the YouTube algorithm. So first, I'll cover why
I'm not investor in Apple and later explain why Apple
should work so much to grow. So, why do I think is
Steve Jobs was alive, he would fire Tim Cook? Do you remember the moments
when Steve Jobs announced the iPhone? It was so mind
blowing and inspiring. (Applause) - And we are calling it iPhone. (Cheering, applause) Today, (two second pause)
today Apple is going to reinvent the phone. - Do you remember the innovation? All I see now is optimization, ""Let's make the iPhone better"", ""Let's the iPad better"", ""Oh, let's make the MacBook better!"" My biggest beef with Apple is the shift away from innovation. I also hate the way they pay dividends and do share buybacks. Know paying over three
billion dollars in dividends, and the 400 billion dollar
share buyback program, all that does is please the shareholders. I hate it when they care so
much for the shareholders. - When you do things like
buybacks and dividends, what you are essentially saying is you're throwing your hands up
in the air, and declaring to the world, ""I do not know
what to do with this money."" - Apple's focus should
be on the core business, and the shareholders gets
rewarded with the result of that. See, Apple now has 245 billion
dollars in cash in hand. The biggest argument I always
get from Apple shareholders is they ""Have too much excess
cash, why not use that money to do some share buybacks and dividends?"" No, screw you! That's selfish,
and looking after yourself. That's short term. This is how a fast growing
company cash flow looks like. So, the cash flow from operations,
meaning the profits from selling a product or
service, flow into growth like research and development,
or building more factories. Every cent goes into growth. Because the focus is on growth,
the company makes more money A perfect example of
that is Amazon and Tesla. Then, there are companies
like the banks and telecoms. Most of these companies,
the excess cash flow goes into shareholders like paying
dividends and share buybacks, purely because they got nowhere
to put the money already. Now we come to Apple. Companies like Apple have
cash flow from operations flowing into R&D, and
shareholders, doing both. The signs that they do
not know where to put the excess cash to grow and expand. Again, the biggest argument I
always get from shareholders is they ""have too much excess cash"" Again, no you selfish prick! With 245 billion dollars cash on hand, a fraction of it can go to things like vertical integration,
like what Tesla is doing. A company that size, and
you want to depend on China? China? Hello, are you mad? You saw a small preview
of what a trade wall if gone full scale could
have hurt Apple, right? Hundred billion dollars
would be more than enough for vertical integration. To put their jobs in America and bring jobs back to America. Do you know how that would boost America? If Apple doesn't know
where to put the next hundred billion dollars, I
have tons of suggestions. How about, do a like help start up fund to fund companies and support
them with Apple's technology? A good example of this is
(inaudible), the stocks I own Well in their startups, Grail
reached their own 20 percent found a way to detect 50
different kind of cancers with just a drop of blood. That changes mankind. That is innovation. Do I see Apple doing any of the above? All these suggestions will no doubt make America great again. Instead, Tim Cook decides to play it safe, and please the shareholders. I
have no respect for that guy. Okay, I'm done with my rant, so now lets go to the good part, where
the Apple shareholders want to ignore. Apple's biggest profit engine
will be selling iPhones. We all know that it's shifting away. Growth been stalling, and
it's very clear that Apple is moving towards generating
profits from software. Introduction of AppleTV
and Apple Arcade last year, the direction is super clear. It's like how software
companies are switching from one (inaudible) to a subscription model. Subscription model
brings consistent revenue month after month for the
lifetime of the customer. This is what Apple wants. Apple is in the best position
to take advantage of this. See, once you are locked
into the Apple ecosystem, you are stuck. So imagine this. All Apple needs to do is sell
you an iPhone at zero profits, they win the game. Competition will fall. I'll give you an example of the numbers. Let's say for if every
hundred thousand phones that Apple sells at zero profits,
but 20 percent of the people pay for software or services, I'm just being conservative,
you scale that up worldwide. Apple will be worth a
few trillion dollars. Apple have yet to do that
move, but you can see from the launch of the new iPhone
SE, a 400 dollar iPhone, and there's no competition! Here is my prediction, and
I'm certain it will come true. That phone will sell out,
take massive market share locking in more people
into Apple's ecosystem. Software revenue will
massively jump, watch for it. Let's revisit this video in a year. I'm certain my predictions will come true. Okay, let me know in the comments
below if you are planning to own Apple shares, if
you own Apple shares, or are you planning to sell
Apple stock after this video. You know I read every single comment, because my main purpose of doing this, videos like this, is to help people. Concluding this video, you
see as an entrepreneur, I admire Apple's business model. But as a person I hate them. As a creator, I love their products, and as a person again, I hate Tim Cook (growls) That's why I'm not
investing in Apple anymore. I'd rather invest in Elon Musk, obviously. Also, I know there is
plenty of requests for another video on my
stock of Alumina, Square, and my overall portfolio. Yes, it's coming up. I already did a video for one of each, so you know the good stuff, I'm going into more details soon. Appreciate the thumbs up,
as always, invest safe.

54,xf1E-QQw9-0," what's up everyone brad here from the money dad 
channel in this video i want to talk about apple   and a pattern that i see on its stock chart that 
projects uh bullish activity going forward uh very   bullish for the stock according to this pattern 
i want to show it to you guys because i think   you know this looks really good for the stock 
going forward there could be some money to be   made here in a trade or if you are just bullish 
on this stock in this company you are long   on this stock and company for the long term then 
this might be something that you want to see   because this is a very good sign for this stocking 
company going forward i think according to this   stock chart pattern anyway so let's jump in i've 
got trading view open on the screen you can see   apple's stock chart we're looking at it right now 
in candlesticks and uh i've got it all the way   back until february of 2020 and we've had this 
great bull trend going uh since the march uh   pandemic lows and uh looks like we reached a 
high here in august september time frame and   we've been kind of chopping sideways a little bit 
low but generally just kind of chopping chopping   sideways since then and then right around well 
what's this time frame the end of december   we reached those highs again 
right and some may think   that this is a double top which is a bad sign a 
double top is when you kind of you hit that same   previous high and you don't break 
through it so if you draw a line   it's literally you know you've reached the 
top twice it's a double top and it's not   a good sign for a stock because it shows 
that you've reached a certain price level   and you failed to break through it two times in a 
row and that can be considered a bearish or a bad   sign for a stock uh i don't see that here 
and i'm going to tell you why right now i   don't see a double top i see a potential cup and 
handle pattern i do think that double tops happen   they happen often but some double tops are cup 
and handle patterns which can be disguised as   double tops so you have to be careful when you're 
looking at double tops now if this price action   would have you know if we would have hit this 
and then we chopped up and reached it again   and chopped lower or something like that yeah 
that would have been a double top to me anyway   but this is not a double top this to me is a 
cup and handle pattern because we have this   bull trend going up right we already confirmed 
that we see this huge bull trend coming up   we've got what looks like a double top right 
here well that was a really bad line let me uh   let me try that again that we have 
this what looks like a double top   right here right we've got these two peaks 
that top out right around the same level   it looks like a double top but the price action 
in between creates a cup okay that's a good sign   because now we're creating what's called a cup and 
handle pattern let me click over to google i just   googled cup and handle pattern click on images 
and you get a billion of these okay you guys can   do this yourself it's super easy i just clicked 
on one that i thought was a decent representation   of what i'm trying to explain in this video it's a 
cup and handle pattern for a stock you need a bull   trend going into it and then you have a peak 
here you have a price action that resembles a   cup so a rounded bottom and then you have a peak 
and a handle so kind of a consolidation phase   where you're just kind of chopping to the side 
or slightly lower and then you break out of   that handle eventually and after that breakout you 
shoot to the upside okay so this is a very bullish   pattern for a stock but you have to make 
sure that you are meeting all the wickets   you're you're you're meeting the requirements 
here for a cup and handle pattern so what are   the requirements for a cup and handle pattern well 
we've already gone over a couple of them one of   them is a bull trend one of them is a a double 
kind of a double top right you've got these two   spots here that create the the top of the cup the 
lid i like to call it right you've got your lid   right there and then you have a handle forming 
right so we're getting close to having a full   cup and handle pattern on apple right and maybe 
like some coffee in your in your cup so we'll   get some steam going there this isn't quite 
bullish yet until we have more price action   that breaks above the lid of this cup okay we need 
these candlesticks to keep chopping higher we need   to break above the lid of this cup and after 
we do that i will be extremely bullish on this   stock extremely bullish the reason why is because 
we can actually measure an exact price target to   the upside after we break out from that handle we 
can put a price target on that based on the depth   of this cup let's go ahead and let's go ahead 
and measure the depth right now let's let's   figure out what that price target is going 
to be if we think maybe that's the bottom   of our cup right there the bottom of that 
candlestick we can go ahead and measure it to the lid of the cup and you get about 30. and 75 
cents okay so that is our measurement 30.75 cents   if we think that this handle chops straight back 
up to the lid from here then we take our ruler   and we go thirty dollars and seventy cents from 
right there that lid we measure up thirty dollars   and seventy 75 cents and we get a price target 
of 170.50 that is the price target on apple if   this handle continues to chop up and break out 
above that lid of this cup okay this is a reliable   stock chart pattern this is not voodoo magic cup 
and handle patterns have been proven by historical   data to be more reliable than not right they 
win trades more often than they lose they are   a winning bet um this is not you know just some 
random crap i'm throwing on the screen here i'm   telling you guys cup and handle patterns work more 
often than not what i'm not telling you is this is   not a hundred percent right this is not definitely 
going to happen this is a probability play   and it's also not a play until we break out 
above the lid we need this to chop higher   this handle needs to finish forming get above this 
lid and then we enter a trade and we target 170   and 50 cents and even then it's not a hundred 
percent that we are going to head straight up   to 170 it is more likely than not that we will do 
that but we're working with probabilities here you   know so it's it there's no guarantee that that's 
going to happen it's just more likely than not   so with all of these stock chart pattern trades 
we deal with probabilities we don't enter trades   that have less than 50 chance of playing out 
right because that's that's a losing trade   we're just losing money it just doesn't make sense 
we enter trades that have a more than 50 percent   chance of playing out and cupping handles 
having more than 50 chance of playing out   and what's nice about seeing a cup and handle 
on a massive mega cap blue chip stock like apple   you know the biggest [ __ ] the biggest company 
in the united states is that there's not nearly   as much volatility with this stock if we end up on 
the losing side of a trade right if this doesn't   go to 170 if we break out above that lid and 
for whatever reason we just start to break down   we're not going to lose a ton of money because 
it's a giant it's a mega cap company it only   moves a couple percent a day at the most 
right it's not one of these micro caps   that we trade on this channel as well like 
fuel cell and things like that you know like   those kinds of stocks will move ten percent a day 
and that's a normal day whereas apple if it moves   three or four percent in a day that's a massive 
day for apple right so we're not risking our bank   account on this on this trade here right so that 
that's what's kind of nice about this meanwhile   we have a price target to the upside that is 30 
on a 130 dollar stock you know we're talking 22   percent upside it says it right here 22 percent 
upside on this trade that's pretty nice upside   for a company that has pretty low volatility 
compared to some of the other trades that were   we're getting into on this on this stock on 
on this channel right so i really like the   risk reward here i mean apple has done nothing 
but gone straight up for decades it feels like   so i don't know why you would bet against 
this company if you bet on this company   going up you're almost always going to be 
right and we have a cup and handle pattern   on this company that suggests it is going up so 
i mean the stars are kind of aligning here for   apple i really like what i'm seeing i love the 
products i love the company you know i'm a big   buyer of their products you know i invest in their 
stock long term but for the short term you know   this this channel has kind of become more about 
short-term trades apple looks really good in the   short term especially if we can break above this 
lid right here this handle can complete its handle   break above this lid then we enter that trade 
and we're targeting 170 dollars it looks very   good for apple in the short term okay so that's 
what i've got for apple long story short i am a   fan of apple long term that said uh this video 
was about the short term trade for apple which   is bullish so my outlook on apple is bullish short 
term bullish long term bullish medium term bullish   everything apple i just see a stock chart pattern 
that should play out over the short to medium term   uh that is very bullish for apple i think we are 
going to 170 dollars probably if we can break   above this uh lid that is in the 139 dollar range 
so really that's our that's our current target is   we need to get above 139 if we get above 139 
i think we're going to 170 quickly okay that's   what i got for apple in this video i hope you

55,YvYzvOTADAE," Hi,  David here.  Apple is an incredible
company and its stock is near an all-time high.  Apple is reporting earnings in just
a couple of weeks.  Today I'm gonna take you behind the scenes and I'm going
to show you how to put on a straddle, an options strategy right before Apple's
earnings.  This strategy when done right has been profitable in the last
four Apple earnings.  This trade has unlimited upside potential and it has
great downside potential.  Most importantly, if you place the trade the
way I'm going to show you today, you have a low risk of losing money.  I'm in one
of my live trading accounts.  You can see here I'm looking at Apple ticker
AAPL.  The stock is trading right now around $385
a share.  I have open here the options for the 31st of July 2020.  Remember, Apple
is reporting earnings on Thursday July 30th after the bell, so these options
expire the very next day. I love to trade stocks around earnings.  Apple is
no exception!  I'm looking now at the VXAPL.  This is the VIX on Apple on
Apple stock. It's basically a volatility index on Apple stock itself.
This is just the last five days.  You can see there's plenty of movement. A
few weeks out it's not uncommon for implied volatility to rise as the
earnings date approaches with Apple. In addition, although this doesn't happen
all the time, sometimes on Apple you can get a big move with earnings.  There
are literally hundreds of different types of trades that you can put on near
earnings that involve stocks and options and different combinations.  Today I'm
going to be talking about a long straddle which is simply buying a
call and buying a put. I'm going to get into detail on that in just a moment. I'm
gonna be talking about two different strategies that involve a long straddle.
The first strategy, we will call it strategy number one.  I'm going to be using these
options right here. In other words, the options that expire the day after the
earnings report.  By the way,  this is a strategy that's common and  it's talked about
all the time on YouTube.  I will say this
it is not my favorite strategy.  As you will see,  as we go on I'm gonna
recommend that you avoid doing this strategy.  I think there's a better
strategy. The second strategy is the one that I
really enjoy doing.  If I'm gonna do a trade on Apple this time or this
earnings season it will definitely be this Apple options strategy.  It involves the options
right here.  They are way out and expire the 15th of January 2021,  191 days out. I'm going to talk about what I
like and what I don't like about with each strategy and you'll understand why it is
that I choose this one.   I'm also gonna do a little bit of back testing.  I'm gonna
go back to Apples earnings for April 30th, earlier this year.  I'm gonna show you why I like this strategy so much more than this one. With this first strategy,  all we're really doing is we are buying a straddle
we are buying a straddle right near the strike price, one two or three weeks out.
I'm going to talk about that in just a second.  I'm changing the contracts here
down to one. You can see our price is $28.05.  If we were to buy
this right now our total cost would be $2,805, plus we can't forget commissions, if you have Commission's on your trading
platform.  So what I want to do is I want to take a look and I want to analyze
the risk on this trade. Let me take a look here and go to risk profile and
move this over a little bit.  You can see this is the risk profile on this
trade. You can see it is basically a V. This is where the stock is trading
currently right in this range right here. Right around $380. At expiration,  in other
words if we held this straddle all the way till expiration,  how would we profit.
This is the put side and this is the call side.  If the stock is trading
lower than about $351, we would be profitable to
the downside.  On the upside,  if AAPL stock is trading higher than about $481, we would have profit to the upside.  The reason that you put this trade on one two or three weeks out
before earnings, is you're hoping to profit based on one of two things.  Either
implied volatility increases and the price of your options will go higher,  in
which case you will make money. Or number two,  there is a big move in the stock
prior to earnings.  In other words,  the stock is here and let's say it it has a
big move.  It gets some bad news before earnings and all of a sudden it trades
down here. Guess what? This position has begun to become profitable.
Maybe it has some really good news or the price of the stock gets
crazy right before earnings,  and it really rises higher.  It gets up in
this range,  and boom you have a lot of profitability.  This is a great trade
if you're gonna have a significant move in the stock either from implied
volatility changing the options, or from the stock price actually moving a
significant amount in one direction or the other.  As you can imagine,  there
is definite risk to this strategy and it comes in this area right in here.  In
other words,  what if the implied volatility doesn't change much?  What if
the options keep going down as we get closer to earnings , and you lose money
every day.  What if the stock doesn't actually move what if you hold this all
the way to earnings and then it reports a meager earnings
report, or or a lackluster earnings report?  Then the stock literally stays the
same.  I'm gonna show you an example of that in just a second.  I'm now in an
area called think back and I'm looking back to April 30th which was the last
time that Apple reported earnings.  On April 30th 2020, you can see that Apple on that
day closed at $293.80. It was up $6
for the day. Let's say that we wanted to put this trade on,  in other
words our strategy number one. Let's say that we had put this
trade on in the last earnings report. We go back a couple of weeks to the the 15th. We go back to the 15th
of April a couple of weeks before earnings and we have this great idea!
We're gonna put on a straddle.  So we look at May 1st AAPL options.  This is
the one that expires you know basically the day after the the earnings report. We
look at the $284.43 stock price. We're gonna put on the $285 straddle.  Here we buy the straddle.   Let's take the contracts
down to one.  What are we looking for is we're trying to find out here
whether or not this trade would have been profitable.  Let's look at it two
ways.  Let's look at it first if we held it and hoped for implied volatility, or
we hoped an increase in implied volatility.  Or,  we hope for a big move in
the AAPLstock.  Let's take it to the day of earnings.  Not after earnings,  but the
day of earnings. Let's see what happens. 
Uh oh we can see right here we lost $815.  in other words, implied volatility was not on our side.
Implied volatility definitely increased a little bit, but guess what? Time decay.
In other words,  the options going down over a two-week period lost some
money. In addition, let's see what happened to the stock.  It was trading at
$284 and we fast-forward out to that day. It's trading at $293 so it did move
up a little bit, but it just wasn't enough to move this straddle to make our
position profitable. The next thing we would look at is what if we just
held it and we waited till after earnings.  Maybe there'll be a big move in
the stock and then we can make some profit as well.   Let's take a look at
what happens the day after earnings. The stock went down. The stock did basically
nothing. We can see that right here. Let's change the date. The stock had
earnings on this day and the very next day what did it do?  It only traded down
$4.  It didn't have a lot of movement. What happened?  Our straddle
imploded.  Okay our straddle that expires the same day just imploded.   We
lost $1,829, out of basically
a $2,200 investment.  So we've lost most of our money hoping that
the stock would either have a big move or implied volatility would rise. For that reason,  I'm just not a big fan of this strategy.  There are times
when this strategy ends up being a home run. Where the price of the of the stock
will move and it'll move in a huge amount in a short period of time, or
right after earnings or implied volatility will increase massively going
into earnings and this will be very profitable.  My problem with this
trade is I believe it has too much risk for the reward. Let's take a look at
strategy number two and this is the one that I like.  It is the exact same trade.  
In other words,  you are buying a call and you are buying a put. Of course you
are hoping that the stock has a big move. Here is how I do this trade
differently. I do this trade the day of the earnings.
If Apple is going to report earnings on July 30th, 
then I'm going to put this trade on July 30th.  I'm gonna put it on July
30th midday or near the the end of the day, so that I don't have to worry
about time decay.  I'm only worried about implied volatility and a move on
the stock. After earnings, we do typically see what we call a
volatility crush. In other words, we see volatility coming down especially on the
near term options. These options right here.
We see that you can lose money for sure that way.   Let me show you
how this trade is a little bit different when it comes to how much it is affected
if the stock has a small move.  We go back to that same the last earnings
report April 30th.  We're back to April 30th the last time that Apple released
earnings.  The stock closed at $293.80 that day.  Here is what we do. Prior to the closing
Bell,  we're going to put on a long straddle.  We are gonna go way out, so
I'm going out all the way 260 days. I'm gonna put on the straddle at the $295
price, which happens to be right around where the stock is trading. Let's take a look.  Here you can see it. Here is the trade right here. I'm
going to lower the contracts down to one so we're comparing apples to apples with
the last trade. Notice the price $65.25, meaning
that if I put this trade on it's gonna cost me $6,500.  The cost is a lot more money than putting on the straddle that
is close to the expiration date.  As we know from already looking at the last
earnings report, Apple didn't do much.  In other words, let's take a look at what it
did when it dropped $4.73. Obviously there was
a drop in volatility meaning that this big expensive trade surely lost money.  In
other words, this trade surely would have lost money.  We can see what actually
happened.  We go to the next day and low and behold this trade is profitable, even
though the stock had virtually no move. Even though it was an expensive straddle.
Even though volatility came down this trade still profited. Why is that? It's because when you go way out you take a lot of the volatility
out of the trade.  In other words,  the options that are 
really close to the date of the earnings are impacted a lot by volatility.  When you go way out you know 200 to 260 days, the trade is not impacted by volatility that much.  In addition,  I'm
only holding the trade for one or two days so time decay really isn't a factor.
What I'm looking for is a big move in the stock on earnings so that I
can make a couple of bucks. It turned out the stock didn't have a big move but
the position the trade still profited. By the way,  this trade has been
profitable in the last four earnings cycles on Apple.  If you enjoyed this

56,J21t-zlj4xg," Hey everyone. This is Kirk here again from optionalpha.com
where we show you how to make smarter trades. In tonight’s video update, I want to go
through the two quick trades that we did have today, two new opening positions. The first one on deck was a new strangle in
SMH. SMH has been one of our more favorite trading
vehicles for the last couple of months. And so, we’re just continuing with another
set of laddered strangles in SMH at 15 Deltas as planned. I mean, it’s really nothing more complicated
than this. It was just a very consistent mechanical entry
here. We want to get into multiple positions in
SMH which is what we’re trying to do. And so, we got into positions in August, got
rid of those. Now, we’re just starting to build out the
September portfolio a little bit. Our original entry on SMH were the 94 short
puts which we still have, the 115 short calls which we still have and then today, we sold
the 116 calls and sold the 97 puts about the 15 Delta on each end, so a very, very mechanical
entry for us, a very systematic trade. The next trade or the last trade for the day
was an iron condor in Apple for earnings, so trying to make a trade on earnings here
with Apple and I actually screwed up in the sense that I tried to actually get into a
couple of contracts with this and I wish I would’ve gotten into more contracts, but
for some reason, I think I replaced the order and I was trying to get it at 108, 109, somewhere
around there and went replacing the order. In trying to get different things, I think
I only typed in one versus a couple of contracts. In either case, we’re still going to do
the position small. We just did one instead of trying to do a
couple of contracts, so that was my bad, my fat finger trade on that. Either way, we’re trying to get outside
of the expected move. Apple’s expected move heading into earnings
was about $8 or so. We tried to get outside of that move. The stock ended the day around 190 and we
wanted to move at least $8 outside of the expected move trading just the weekly contracts. Again, weekly contracts have all the volatility
juice baked into them, so we don't want to trade further out contracts, not as much volatility. Everyone's playing those weekly contracts
because they are happening during the time of the exercise or the earnings announcement
for Apple. The stock ended the day around 190. Expected move was about $8 or so. We sold options $10 out on either end, so
we sold the 180 put spread and we sold the 200 call spread. It looks like we should be pretty close on
this one tomorrow. The stock is trading around 199. We’ll see where it opens up tomorrow. But here's the stock afterhours. You can see actually, the earnings event happened,
but it's hit up against this 197, 198 range already a couple of times and kind of fallen
off of that. We’ll see where it goes from there. We still have some movement up to 200. It could easily get there. But I think we actually should be okay on
this one and again, we just closed out of the call spread side tomorrow, hopefully after
the implied volatility crush, taking some profits off the table. That’s pretty much it. As always, if you guys have any questions,
let me know and until next time, happy trading.",AAPL,"['Hey', 'everyone', 'This', 'is', 'Kirk', 'here', 'again', 'from', 'optionalpha', 'com', 'where', 'we', 'show', 'you', 'how', 'to', 'make',

57,iQdfVJdeDZI, known everyone this is matt / milestone capital growth portfolio com today is Monday June eighth nice day in the market dippin very very nicely that continues but we have support coming up and if you remember please check out the video tonight because we will have that support and the different trade setups for you at that point as you know we've been doing very well to the downside so now let's make some money to the upside when it's time when it's time let's take a look at the Apple trade the Apple trade they had the conference today nothing exciting but it was just stuck in a it's stuck in a pattern it topped out and that was as simple as that we had a double top right here and then she started heading down doesn't matter what the news is doesn't matter what's going on because Apple does the same thing up and down just like every other stock they're all controlled it's just that simple so you know if we're looking at a channel on this right now you can see that we kind of have this channel right here you have a downtrend and you know it this is a couple factors where you can figure out what the bottom is a relative strength index on the daily now is at 4523 so we have a little bit more downside it did however bounce back up into this trend line today and it's it's holding there but let's take a look at what a target would be and we're going to use the hourly break it right down a little bit you can see when we hit this low here we bounced up and came right back into this and if we draw this off of the wicks which I prefer to do only because it gives me a little bit more room here you can see we pop back into it okay and here's our upside and here's our downside so potentially we could pop up to the upside but you could see here relative strength index did turn back down after that one little pop there so don't get too excited because we have a target what's our target going to be we have a gap once we hit this gap be prepared to lock and load calls because we're going to get up their relative strength index as a 35 still has room for more downside so we can kiss this goodbye right now because really all we want is this okay now that we move we're moving a little bit faster we can pin this trend line to a much faster trend that it's in right now because this was resistance off of this in this I'll just have to keep this just like this for now and not this is how fast we're going to go so we should be here and time so keep an eye out for that and once we hit this we should bounce right back up again and then remember this trend line has to be broken for it to get back into that up pattern okay and then you'll have another trend line over here but we'll go over that again congratulations on airlines they are doing fantastic you had them at the top and they are dropping continuously if you look at Delta you can see it looks bad all right let's get back to the daily and I told you what the targets were before I will reiterate them and here's my target and here's my first one we just hit it the 4103 congratulations from 50 that's a nine dollar move that's the first gap right here we will be bouncing back and forth and everything is the next one right here and we should do really well after that so congratulations to delta u al and all those we're riding to riding those to the downside so any little pops they will resume the drops all right this is matt over milestone capital growth portfolio com remember if you not a member become one today have a great afternoon,AAPL,"['known', 'everyone', 'this',

58,J31rd7tRPow, microsoft is currently the third largest company in the world by market cap and one of the big five tech giants alongside google apple amazon and facebook in its 45 years of business microsoft has fueled its growth through constant innovation and major acquisitions a single dollar invested in microsoft at its 1986 ipo would have turned into 3 864 by 2021. that's with dividends reinvested of course this amounts to a total return of 386 436 percent or 26.68 annually you can just imagine the crazy wealth that's created in fact of early microsoft employees with stock four have become billionaires and at least 12 000 have become millionaires but can an investment in microsoft today still build wealth in this video i'm going to do a comprehensive overview of microsoft's current business and explain whether it deserves a place in your long-term dividend stock portfolio [Music] my name is zach and you should leave a like and subscribe to the channel if you enjoy the video you should never invest in a business you don't understand so today i'm going to provide a full picture look at microsoft first let's recap the company's history microsoft was founded in 1975 by childhood friends bill gates and paul allen both were obsessed with computer programming and had business aspirations inspired by the january 1975 cover of popular electronics magazine gates and allen developed a basic interpreter for a new personal computing device called the altair 8800 after striking a distribution deal for the software gates dropped out of harvard and alan quit his job in order to create microsoft the name was an obvious choice for them because they were creating software for micro processors so micro soft by 1980 microsoft entered the operating system business they earned a contract from ibm to be its pc's operating system they created ms-dos which propelled microsoft to become the leading pc operating systems vendor paul allen would resign from microsoft in 1983 after developing hodgkin's disease in late 1985 microsoft released windows which was their first graphical user interface for the ms-dos operating system this followed the 1984 release of the apple macintosh which first brought this concept to market this window-based point-click gui system made personal computers far more accessible to the average person in 1986 microsoft became a public company traded under the ticker symbol msft by 1990 they introduced the microsoft office suite which bundled separate applications such as word and excel they would continue to release new versions of office along with their windows os in 1995 the company released windows 95 which featured multitasking a start button 32-bit compatibility and internet explorer microsoft absolutely dominated the computer os market share at this time especially after apple declined from the steve jobs removal this led to a highly publicized anti-trust lawsuit arguing the company was a monopoly on january 13 2000 bill gates handed over the ceo position to long-time microsoft employee steve ballmer ladies and gentlemen gates then transitioned to a new role called chief software architect in 2001 microsoft released the widely popular windows xp and the xbox which was their first move into the video game console industry in 2008 they launched microsoft azure originally designed for developers to deploy apps in the cloud azure soon became a core microsoft service that grew to include hundreds of applications in 2009 they launched the bing search engine which failed to seriously compete with google but gathered valuable data for the company in 2011 office expanded to the cloud with the introduction of office 365. also microsoft acquired skype for 8.5 billion dollars that same year in 2012 they launched the surface line of tablet pcs on february 4th 2014 steve ballmer stepped down as ceo of microsoft and was succeeded by satya nadella nadella previously led microsoft's cloud and enterprise division that year they purchased the video game minecraft for 2.5 billion dollars in 2015 they launched windows 10. in 2016 they bought linkedin for 26.2 billion dollars in 2017 they launched microsoft teams in 2018 they acquired github for 7.5 billion dollars on march 13 2020 gates announced that he was leaving microsoft's board of directors in order to focus more on his philanthropic efforts on september 21st 2020 microsoft announced its intent to acquire zenimax media for 7.5 billion dollars the deal is expected to occur in the second half of 2021's fiscal year now that was a lot to go over but it really only scratches the surface of microsoft's history the company is quite literally a tech giant and has transformed significantly over the years so what does microsoft's business look like today it can be broken up into three main segments productivity and business processes intelligent cloud and personal computing the productivity and business processes segment includes microsoft office linkedin and dynamics office is the suite of productivity software microsoft has provided for decades at this point if you haven't heard of them you'll likely have been living under a rock it includes word excel powerpoint onenote outlook access exchange teams sharepoint onedrive publisher etc the office business is split between consumer and commercial focus over the past few years microsoft has been transitioning its customers from the licensed on-premise softwares of years past to the cloud-based office 365. this uses the subscription-based business model which creates a reliable recurring revenue for the company additionally it removes the problem of people not wanting to spend money to upgrade to the newer versions of the software this was a growing problem as it became more difficult over time to make compelling improvements to the incremental versions additionally this new model will allow the team to focus on supporting one version of the software since most users will be using the same this cloud-based subscription is a better business model and better for the end consumer it allows customers to easily get the most up-to-date software and access their files from any device while creating a growing base of consistent revenue for the company microsoft office still rakes in huge profit and you can see why when you take a look at the plans they offer for home you can spend 69.99 a year as an individual or 99.99 as a family for business they offer plans on a per user basis for example their standard plan is 12.50 per user per month and their premium version is 20 dollars per user per month you can just imagine how quickly this revenue scales up at corporations with thousands and thousands of employees from 2019 to 2020 office commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 3.1 billion dollars or 12 percent driven mostly by office 365 commercial growth of 24 office consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 458 million dollars or 11 percent with continued growth in office 365 consumer subscribers to 42.7 million however the office suite has significant competition there are countless alternatives to their various products and many are free of charge most notably google has made a significant move in this area they have competitors to most of the office suite and offer them online for free also these services are extremely well integrated into google chrome which is a far more popular web browser than microsoft's current edge browser microsoft does now offer free versions of the office software online but google is a real competitor in this area i find myself using their services far more often even though i have microsoft office it's so well integrated into google chrome that it's become my default even in the writing of this video i used google docs over word despite this competition microsoft's office suite is growing and will continue to be a cash cow for the company the products constantly improve and are heavily integrated between each other this creates a software ecosystem that helps retain customers additionally the scale and experience of this division and microsoft allow them to quickly move to new areas and innovate their suite this is most recently seen by microsoft teams which aims to compete with services like slack microsoft office has evolved significantly over the past decade and i expect it will continue to linkedin is another big part of this segment for microsoft this is a social network that connects business professionals and companies linkedin generates revenue through premium subscriptions talent solutions market solutions and sales solutions these are various services which are detailed more in microsoft's 2020 annual report this will be linked in the description of the video linkedin has over 700 million members and its revenue increased 1.3 billion dollars or 20 percent from 2019 to 2020. growth depends on the ability to increase the number of linkedin members and continue offering new services that provide value linkedin was acquired for 26.2 billion dollars and it seems like that will be successful investment for the company long term it faces some competition but is the largest social network in the professional field by far the third part of this segment is dynamics this provides cloud-based and on-premise business solutions for financial management enterprise resource planning customer relationship management supply chain management and other application development platforms for businesses of all sizes dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed expansion of revenue per user and the continued shift to the cloud-based sas model of dynamics 365. they compete with vendors such as oracle and salesforce dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 14 from 2019 to 2020 driven by dynamics 365 growth of 42 percent the intelligent cloud segment of microsoft consists of server products cloud services and enterprise services their cloud services are the fastest growing part of the company through microsoft azure this is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers and enterprises the freedom to build deploy and manage applications on any platform or device customers use azure through a global network of data centers for computing networking storage mobile and web application services ai internet of things cognitive services and machine learning azure cloud computing enables customers to devote more resources to development and use applications rather than managing on-premise hardware and software azure revenue grew 56 from 2019 to 2020 due to the growth and consumption-based services this section of the company is where they will likely see their largest growth over the next decade azure faces formidable competition from companies like amazon google ibm oracle vmware and open source offerings they are currently second behind amazon web services and market share and those two are the clear leaders by far microsoft server products are designed to make it professionals more productive and efficient this includes sql servers windows servers visual studio system center and github github provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers github controls 88.46 of the market share and source code management server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs licenses sold to oems and retail packaged products overall server products and cloud services revenue increased 8.8 billion dollars or 27 from 2019 to 2020 driven mostly by azure the final part of microsoft's intelligent cloud is their enterprise services this includes premier support services and microsoft consulting services these assist customers in developing deploying and managing microsoft server and desktop solutions it also provides training and certification to developers and it professionals on various microsoft products enterprise services revenue increased 285 million dollars or five percent from 2019 to 2020 driven by growth in the premier support services the personal computing segment of microsoft includes windows surface devices and accessories gaming and search windows is the operating system you've likely used many times over your life among desktop computers it controls 76.26 of market share with a gigantic lead over competition among all devices it controls 31.6 percent of market share behind only android windows is mainly broken between oem revenue and commercial revenue windows oem revenue is impacted significantly by the number of windows os licenses purchased by oems which they pre-install on the devices they sell for example this is like when you go and buy an hp or dell laptop and it has windows pre-installed windows commercial revenue includes volume licensing of the windows os and windows cloud services such as microsoft defender advanced threat protection windows revenue increased 1.9 billion dollars or nine percent from 2019 to 2020. the devices section includes microsoft surface line and pc accessories surface is designed to be a flagship line for windows where microsoft can highlight what a windows pc can be it started with their tablet pc form factor in the surface pro after a slow start this has actually become a very popular product line i've used one in the past and i genuinely liked it over time the surface line has expanded to include various laptops tablet pcs and desktops the quality and care microsoft has put into building this brand makes me think they can genuinely compete with not only other windows computer manufacturers but even apple microsoft recently announced that they will be now manufacturing their own chips for their surface pcs and servers this move is widely successful for apple's recent product refresh and should be a wise move for microsoft to follow i think surface is here to stay and will be a growing part of microsoft in the future surface revenue increased 457 million dollars or eight percent from 2019 to 2020. microsoft's gaming segment consists of the xbox console and its related services the next generation xbox is recently launched with the xbox series s and xbox series x demand seems high based on the fact they've been sold out for months but the supply has been low i actually just got an xbox series s after a few months of it being out of stock i've got to finish this video though before i can start playing anyway it's safe to assume that they're being beat out by playstation 5 and sales based on recent trends however console sales are not where the money is made in fact most next-gen consoles are sold at a loss the money is made in the services and games sold to users the future of xbox is as a platform not a console microsoft realizes this and has been transitioning xbox towards this future xbox revenue mainly consists of subscriptions and sales of first party and third party games historically xbox live has been the cash cow this allows you to play games online with friends for a monthly subscription of 9.99 xbox live currently has 90 million monthly users however they've been pushing a transition to a newer service called xbox game pass this subscription offers access to a library of over 100 games that you can download and play this is a far more cost effective way to try out and play various games xbox is treating the service with the highest priority they are offering tons of high quality games and trying to get new games on the service at the same day of launch this is available for 9.99 a month but for 14.99 a month you can get game pass and xbox live combined this service is a fantastic value considering most games cost between 30 and 60 dollars game pass now has over 18 million subscribers but wait there's more xbox game pass now includes a beta of cloud gaming this means you can stream these games directly to your xbox console windows 10 pc phone or tablet this removes the extra step of downloading games improving the ease of use also this allows you to play a game on practically any device over time this will turn xbox game pass into the netflix of gaming you'll be able to browse over a library and instantly pick and play any game the future of gaming is cloud streaming because it removes reliance on the powerful hardware needed to game microsoft is using their azure cloud technology to allow this on-demand streaming of games to pcs consoles and mobile devices this integration under microsoft's umbrella gives them a massive competitive advantage over other gaming companies xbox is well aware that these streaming services will be the future of gaming the business model will be more similar to netflix and disney plus than anything else they will need to focus on exclusive games and having constant compelling releases to reduce churn so you know what that means content is king in the past this has been a weaker area of xbox compared to playstation and nintendo they had far less exclusive first party games microsoft has been focusing to make sure that they improve in this area over the past few years xbox has been building their first party games through xbox game studios in 2014 they acquired mojang studios who created minecraft in 2018 they made a slew of acquisitions they bought undead labs who creates the game's state of decay that's actually one of my favorite games by the way and i think the development team is wildly talented they bought playground games who creates the popular forza racing series they also acquired obsidian games who makes high-quality rpgs they recently released the outer worlds which was a critical success previously they developed licensed games like fallout new vegas and south park the stick of truth both of which were top notch quality obsidian is a massive acquisition for xbox game studios other 2018 acquisitions include studios like ninja theory in exile entertainment and compulsion games in 2019 they bought double fine productions which has made popular games like psychonauts however the biggest acquisition of them all came in 2020 when they acquired zenimax media for 7.5 billion dollars this blockbuster deal got them top-notch video game studios and major franchises this includes bethesda game studios who makes fallout and the elder scrolls series hid software who makes doom wolfenstein 3d and quake arcane studios who made dishonored and prey machine games who has made the newer wolfenstein games and much more this is huge and an obvious signal that xbox knows content ownership will be incredibly important in the area of game streaming services xbox game studios already includes 343 studios and the coalition who have made the popular xbox exclusives halo and gears of war respectively despite all this you can still make the argument that playstation and nintendo have stronger first party games but they are undoubtedly falling behind in the area of technology and business model xbox has the first mover advantage in the game streaming service and has been addressing their content weaknesses i could see them gaining an early lead in the streaming wars and cementing themselves as a major player in the future of gaming if you can't tell i think microsoft is doing a lot right with xbox if i could invest solely on xbox i would but honestly they're far better off being a part of microsoft this has grant the massive capital resources and azure cloud integration microsoft gaming revenue increased 189 million dollars or 2 percent from 2019 to 2020. xbox content and services increased 943 million dollars or 11 the prior year it grew 19 xbox hardware revenue declined 31 though primarily due to a decrease in volume and prices of consoles sold production constraints through the 2020 mess and being prior to a new console launch understandably reduced these numbers significantly alright so that's the end of gaming the final part of microsoft's personal computing segment is their search business this includes bing and microsoft advertising bing has obviously lost the search war to google and it's not even close google has 87.74 percent of the search engine market share in the us leaving bing in second was 6.25 percent the stats are even worse for bing globally although it's not really too competitive six percent can still provide value to microsoft they earn revenue from advertising and collect valuable data search advertising revenue increased 112 million dollars or one percent from 2019 to 2020. so that should give you a good understanding of microsoft's current business now let's take a look at some of its fundamentals since we just analyzed the company by its three segments let's take a look at the financial results of those segments for revenue productivity and business processes increased from 35.86 billion in 2018 to 46.49 billion in 2020. this is a 13.7 compound annual growth rate in this segment intelligent cloud increased from 32.2 billion in 2018 to 48.36 billion in 2020. this is a 22.5 compound annual growth rate personal computing increased from 42.27 billion in 2018 to 48.25 billion in 2020. this is a 6.8 compound annual growth rate operating income saw even greater growth over this time frame productivity and business processes increased from 12.92 billion in 2018 to 18.72 billion in 2020. this is a 20.36 compound annual growth rate intelligent cloud increased from 11.52 billion in 2018 to 18.32 billion in 2020. this is a 26 compound annual growth rate personal computing has increased from 10.61 billion in 2018 to 15.91 billion in 2020. this is a 22.45 compound annual growth rate if you can't tell already microsoft is an absolute powerhouse of a company as a whole the revenue profit operating income net income and free cash flow have all been steadily growing at sizable rates for a long time over the last 10 years their revenue grew from 62.48 billion to 143 billion giving an 8.6 compound annual growth rate their gross profit grew from 50 billion to 96.93 billion giving it a 6.8 compound annual growth rate their operating income has grown from 24 billion to 52.95 billion giving it an 8.2 compound annual growth rate their net income has grown from 18.76 billion to 44.28 billion giving it an 8.9 compound annual growth rate since 2016 their free cash flow per share has nearly doubled going from and fifteen cents to five dollars and ninety four cents in 2020. not only has microsoft been consistently growing for a long time but its rate of growth has increased significantly over the past three to five years this makes sense when you consider all the areas of growth and acquisitions i explained earlier so as a business microsoft looks great both qualitatively and quantitatively but now we need to take a look at the stock as a dividend investor since that's the theme of this channel microsoft's stock price has increased over 380 percent in the last five years the market cap now sits at 1.84 trillion dollars it has a p e of 33 which is right in line with today's overvalued market this all becomes quite clear when you look at microsoft's dividend is a 2.24 annual dividend payout giving it a 0.92 dividend yield at its current price the dividend has a 10.13 5-year compound annual growth rate and has been consistently increasing for over 17 years microsoft is most certainly going to be a dividend aristocrat and likely dividend king in the future the payout ratio is currently 30.4 percent and has been decreasing due to the company's growth outpacing the recent dividend increases so microsoft has a lot of room to increase their dividend over time especially when you account for future growth of the company however the current dividend yield is terribly low compared to microsoft's yield historically this is of course due to the high price it's trading at so microsoft is definitely richly valued at the moment but that doesn't change the fact that it's a quality company that is focused for the long term i think microsoft will continue to innovate and has a fantastic holding in a long term dividend stock portfolio so what's my plan i currently own just two shares of microsoft with a 1.054 percent dividend yield and a cost per share of 212.45 this amounts to only 424.90 invested in the company which is small beans i want to build up microsoft as a core holding of mine over the long term so i'm gonna implement a dollar cost averaging strategy this means i'm going to buy at least one share every month i tend to dollar costs average when i believe heavily in the underlying business and want to build my position for example i'm currently following this with both apple and disney sometimes it's better just to own a quality company rather than get scared off by valuations if the stock goes down then great i'll load up and buy more at a better price in fact that's what i'm hoping for so that's my plan for buying microsoft but don't take my advice blindly and be sure to do your own research before making any investment

Now I just received your new note this morning like I wanted to hit on that before we get into Tesla's here a little bit, but it's pretty positive and I think it's going against the grain here a little bit with what we've seen as far as the market moves this year, with the nasty lagging that the other three major indices, you're looking at 25 to 30% Growth. Maybe in that text based give me a run down here in the note. Yeah Good. I believe this pullback that we've seen rotation trade maniacal focus on the 10 Year. It's created would I've used a golden opportunity in terms of the in the secular winners. We believe tech stocks up another 25-30 percent from here. NASDAQ's 16,000. In cloud inside security and five G and I believe one of you in terms of earnings. That's gonna be a major catalyst the tax base. Toso to me. This is really the opportunity to own Secular winners across clouds, cybersecurity in five Jean look, the heaters AR gonna heat if he had the rather tech rally many of them in here the last 3 to 4 years. We continue thing. This is a blip. Rather than the star veteran. Yeah and I think those that rising interest rate environment that has everybody spooked a little bit on this sector as the 10 year yield kind of stabilizes here, You're gonna get these sectors to get more comfortable at these levels as far as the Growth name goes, and we've seen a little bit of movement back into those names. Now you had a couple big names in their with Apple and my krose, along with nuance. Give me the breakdown here an apple because you're expecting a few more iPhones to sell here, Dan Yeah, I mean, the super cycle thesis we've talked about, you know, it's playing out and we've seen across our agent checks. I think March quarter is gonna be Rebus. I think on a trajectory right now. BBA TENSION 242 150 million units Bride wants would beat the record from 2005 with iPhone six. This isn't this is not just a one year cycle. There's a two year cycle going into IVZ 13 as well. 40.7 base is and when they're buy prepared, doctor that combined with the rearing on service. I think a year from now we're looking at $3 trillion mark happen. Apple Yeah, Go to Microsoft. Go ahead. Go ahead, Dan. But but just you're going in the themes. Five geezer APPLETINI, You'll get cloud. Only 35 of the way through on the cloud ship Microsoft has seemed more and more share gains for exams on actually accelerated as your Growth. I believe this is going to be another game changer quarter. Which is why we love that There are third topic is nuance, healthcare Cloud play, re reading in process, I think right now called a loo $40 stock. I think this is a senior citizen. Stock and neck 6-9 months, and we got those price target upside thinking APPLETINI, 75 and Microsoft 2-3 100 s O pretty optimistic going into the end of the year. We'll have to wait and see on those key. One Those earnings that are coming up here at the end of the month, but I don't want to switch back to Tesler now, Dan, because we did have that upgrade that you that you gave earlier this week, $2000 a share your say that China's booming right now What do your estimates here for? Tesla's the evey, although it's a small component of the auto sales, it's growing at a rapid pace here. Get the green tidal wave and I think we're seeing that kicked off last week in the US. With Baden. But if you look at China that that's the linchpin to the both pieces for testimony seeing skyrocket sounds. In China that could be 40 overall go into next year. Combine that with what we're seeing is green tidal wave in Europe in the U. S. Only 3% of automobiles that AR evey Today we think going 10% next 3 to 4 years, and it's not just hassle. GM through the whole ACWI assistant is being built out, But we believe when I look a task, given deliveries and given where we see numbers when you look out, and there's$1000 stock by the end of this year. Yeah. And if you look at that competition, it is starting to heat up, especially over in Europe. Where you know Audi and some of the other names Volkswagen or are certain to ramp up a little bit there. But if you look at, um you know the competition. You know, it's there for the taking, because the space is growing right? And the new Administracion has his green agenda. What do your expectations for the benefits to not only, you know the E V space, but Tesla in general. Yeah I think that that's something that I still don't think is as appreciate and I think in terms of what's happening in the U. S 7500 credits there capped out in terms of passing GM. 2 200,000 ceiling, I think, as part of this infrastructure bill that that gets removed ceiling to do is get restored for passengers and, of course, bring one buying those cars now that was credits care for story, which I think is significant in the U. S. As well as we believe 10-30 $1000 is what we're hearing could be the pride the next level of tax credits, and that's significant because us is wag behind Europe in China. 2% on Lian terms of evey sows, I believe this is some miss come in leg, not just a Tesla. But to the overall ADV eco system. We believe Warren have trillion of the five trillion In evey of next decades. Coming in the U. S. So eco systems gonna be built out? Yeah, And you mentioned that eco system is the fact that Biden his Administracion, one of their key components of this green agenda is getting more charging station and that's always been a concern. As far as the BEVGS space goes, But what's down the road for Tesla? What's next catalyst? Is it going to be the truck? Is it going to be the semi space that could, you know? Maybe propel the stock even higher? Yeah. Then there's two specific cattle is one. I think we're just ultimately as we go through next few quarters numbers that could be the street by 10 15% I think is that plays out That gets full EEM or digesting the stock, But in terms of the drum roll it cyber trunk. I mean, we think we're starting to get too close to 700,000 pre orders. That's gonna be the next leg along with what we're seeing a model. Why models? Essen at this point is noise. Your see some headway on that. And then you take a step back gold age AVVAA, and I think we're looking at houses $1000",MSFT,"['Welcome', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'watch', 'list', 'I', 'm', 'Tom', 'White', 'filling', 'in', 'for',

60,_g1wvVfcrF8," Hey everyone, in this video, we're going to look 
at Microsoft stock, we're going to look at their   financial statements trying to figure out an 
intrinsic value, and see whether it's worth buying   today.  If you're new to the channel, my name is Dan, 
I do a lot of stock analysis on this channel.  So if   you're into that kind of thing, hit that subscribe 
button to check out more videos like this one.   With that out of the way, let's get into it.  So here 
is Microsoft's three major segments.  First, you got   Productivity and Business Processes that includes 
things like Office 365, Skype, Linkedin, Outlook, and   Onedrive.  Then you've got Intelligent Cloud there 
in the red that includes things like Azure, Github,   Sql Server, and Windows Server.  And finally we got 
More Personal Computing over there in the green,   that's where we have Windows, also Xbox, 
the Surface, and other pc accessories.   So they're pretty well split between the three 
segments.  As far as the geography of their revenues,   It's pretty split between U.S. and other, they don't 
really break it down among the other countries,   they only state that no other country accounts 
for more than 10% of their total revenue.   So they have some diversification going on as 
far as currency risk, and I like to see that.   So here are some fun facts about Microsoft's 
balance sheet that should help us assess the   liquidity and solvency of the company.  They 
have a liabilities to assets ratio of about 59%,   that's pretty healthy.  Their current ratio and 
quick ratio are both above, well, pretty   much above 2.5, that's very healthy there, guys. 
So the current ratio of 2.53 means that our   current asset over 2.5 times what 
our current liabilities are.  We can easily pay   off those current liabilities.  Interest coverage 
ratio is about 22, that's just very healthy, so the   money we earn every year can cover our interest 
expense 22 times. We have a big pile of cash on   the balance sheet.  I have noticed this with a lot 
of the big tech companies, if you saw my Google   or Facebook reviews.  45% of our assets are just 
cash.  We don't have hardly any inventory, and then   the long-term assets account for about 
41% of their total assets.  So not too long-term   asset intensive.  So what's going on with that huge 
pile of cash on the balance sheet for Microsoft?   Well, if we look at their cash tax rate, we may 
find some clues.  The corporate tax rate has been 35%   for most of this time, only being lowered to 21% in 
the year 2017.  Despite that, Microsoft typically   actually pays you know anywhere from 2% to 10% 
in taxes every year.  So guys what's going   on here is that you have a situation where a lot 
of the profits Microsoft earns overseas are not   being repatriated. Microsoft is not bringing 
those profits back here.  Now why are they doing   this?  Well, corporations don't have to pay taxes on 
profits they earn overseas until they bring them   back over here.  So essentially, Microsoft is just 
waiting around, hoping that maybe Congress will   pass a tax holiday like they did in the year 
2004.  And we saw a tremendous amount of money come   back to the U.S. during that time.  Will that happen? 
I don't know.  But we have to kind of discount   the cash on Microsoft's balance sheet.  We have to 
kind of make the assumption that a dollar's worth   of cash on their balance sheet isn't really worth 
quite a dollar.  We're going to have to probably pay   taxes on that.  So what we have here is the Dupont 
analysis.  You can check out my video on that in   the description. But essentially we're taking the 
return on equity or ROE, very important measure of   profitability for a company, and we're breaking it 
down into its three components.  Now why is ROE so   important?  Well, you're an equity investor, whatever 
money we as equity investors put into the stock,   that is our investment base.  So given that amount 
of money we put in, what are we getting back, what's   our return on that in terms of company profit. 
So Microsoft has a pretty sick ROE here.  We're   looking at, you know, anywhere from 35%, 40%, 47% there 
in 2019, doing very well.  Net income margin is one   way they do this.  That tells you for every dollar 
of sales, how much in profits do they generate, and   their net income margin is very healthy, coming in 
at about 32.3% in the most recent period.  So   for every dollar of sales, we bank 32 cents, that's 
very good.  Asset turnovers, once again, very low 0.49,   pretty stable though.  So don't expect that to go up 
or anything.  One thing to keep in mind is the asset   turnover was really being dragged down by that big 
cash pile on the balance sheet.  And then they have   an equity multiplier which is not too dramatic, 
they're not extremely leveraged or anything.   So overall,  I love it!  I love their ROE.  And in 
fact, if you take out the cash, the return on   equity would be even higher, because their asset 
turnover would be even better.  Here is the money   they've spent paying stockholders dividends, and 
also buying their own shares back over the past   five years.  And so these are millions of dollars 
by the way. Dividends, you've got a nice steady   increasing dividend there in blue.  And the share 
buybacks have been going up, and I love to see that.   So Microsoft can very very much afford to continue 
raising that dividends, when you look at their   payout ratio in the blue bars here.  So look in the 
past couple years, their payout ratio is about 5%,  meaning the dividend they give you is 
only 5% of their profits for the year.   Can they afford to continue buying their shares 
back?  Well, heck yeah.  Look at the green there, your   modified payout ratio tells you, Okay, you got your 
dividends plus all the money to buy shares back,   what percentage of net income is spent on that, 
and we're only spending about you know 13% to 15%   of the money we make every year on buybacks 
and dividends combined.  So Microsoft really   is hoarding a lot of cash.  I see them
with some reinvestments, but overall there   really being a cash hoarder right now.  Okay, so 
before I try to value this company, I want to   try and get a sense of how much they've been 
growing by. 15 years ago, I would have told you   they're a mature company, they're not going to be 
growing much and I wouldn't have been wrong.  They   really were flatlining there for a while.  But 
look what's happened recently, they've had just   tremendous growth in net income over the past 
three or four years or so.  I would also say that   Microsoft has a pretty wide moat on a lot of their 
products and services.  You can see a wide moat when   you look at things like margins.  Here's their gross 
margin, extremely high, averaging in around 66% or 69%.   And their operating margins are extremely 
high as well, getting up to about 38% in the   most recent period.  So I don't see a decline in 
margins right now, what I see is the company that   is still able to dictate his prices pretty well. 
Okay, so after looking at everything, I absolutely   love this company.  They're doing excellent, but the 
question is really is the price they're selling   at a good deal right now?  That's ultimately 
all we care about as investors.  To get to   the bottom of that, I need to do an intrinsic 
valuation using a discounted cash flow model.   I'm going to be using the free cash flow to equity 
model to help value the company.  To make the model   work,  I just need to make some assumptions.  So 
whatever values I come up with, it all depends   on those assumptions I'm going to make, and I'm 
going to show you guys how the value would differ   if your assumptions change a little bit.  So even if 
you think my senses are wrong, you can plug in your   own, and kind of see what the value would be.  One of 
the most important assumptions is going to be that   discount rate, we're going to look at the future 
cash flows, and discount them back to present value.   However much we discount them by should be 
a reflection of the risk the company faces.   I think Microsoft is a pretty safe company, 
I can go with a lower discount rate,   as low as 6% really, I think that would be 
fine for Microsoft, but probably no more than 7%.   The second biggest assumption I'm going to have 
to make is how long can they keep growing and what   can they grow by.  So with a market capitalization 
of 1.68 trillion dollars, there are some limits to   growth.  With that being said, they have managed to 
grow, if you look at the charts of their earnings.  The most recent of forecast data I have 
available estimates about a 12.2%   growth rate in earnings per share over the next 
three to five year period.  I'm gonna go with that   growth rate.  I'm going to show you how that would 
differ with higher or lower growth rates though.   And we're going to say that they're not going 
to be able to grow much after about five years.   At that point, they're going to continue to 
grow by, we can say 1% or 2%.   And we'll just go with 1.5%
and that's going to be what they'll grow   at that point. That's just the maturity phase 
of a business.  So if I put all that together,   what's going to be the value of the company?  Well, 
let's have a look.  Okay, so what I've put up here   is evaluation matrix, and this each cell is going 
to show you what is the fair price for a share of   Microsoft stock under two conditions: one is the 
discount rate there on the vertical, and the other   is the free cash flow to equity growth rate on the 
horizontal here.  So for example, if we assume a 12%   growth in free cash flow to equity over the next 
five years, which is where analysts are currently   forecasting, and you want to use a 6%
discount rate, then microsoft would be worth $234.83   per share.  I think this cell right here is probably 
the most likely.  Now, unfortunately, Microsoft   is selling for $222.75 at the time I make this 
video, making it not very much of a discount.  But   if you have different assumptions, if you believe 
Microsoft can grow at much higher rate, for example,   is the most optimistic scenario we have, is a very 
low discount rate, and a very high growth rate,   it could be worth as much as $370. So another 
way of looking at this whole matrix is to say the   following: Okay, I want a 7%t return on 
my investment, I think Microsoft will grow at 14%,   so I need to be paying no more than the value in 
this cell right here, $207.35.  So collectively, when   we look at it, check out the matrix below here.  If 
it's a good deal I put in green, bad deal red.  It's   pretty mixed and I do think 5% discount 
rate is a little bit low.  So for me, I don't think   it looks like a good deal.  One last factor that to 
look at is the insider activity.  So for Microsoft   in the past  months you got 7 insiders 
buying and 7 selling.  If you look at the number   of shares involved, 
you've got about 101,000 shares buy, compared to 340,000 shares sold.  Overall, 
a slightly negative signal about the future of the   company in the near term.  Okay, so here are my 
final thoughts on Microsoft: it's going to be   one of those stocks that I'm going to keep an eye 
on.  After doing the analysis, I love their business,   extremely stable, high profit margins indicating 
a great moat for a lot of their products.  However,   I can't see it being a buy right now.  When you 
plug in the assumptions based on analyst forecast,   and you just look at the matrix, there's really 
not that many scenarios where it turns out to be   a good deal.  I'm also a little bit skeptical about 
analysts forecasting this company growing at 12%   for the next five years.  Their market cap 
is already close to two trillion dollars,   at that point, you know I have to ask 
how much more can they grow?   And so you know for now I'm going to pass on it, 
but I will keep an eye on it.  If the price went   down, all the way down to say $200 a share, I think 
I would jump on that, I would for sure buy Microsoft   if it ever hit $200 a share. Anyhow, those 
are just my thoughts. Let me know in the   comments below how you feel about Microsoft,

61,s1dbE1e5PgA," so microsoft was only up uh less than half a 
percent on friday but where that candlestick   placed on its stock chart is extremely significant 
for this stock chart pattern that projects   big upside potential for microsoft i'm 
gonna show you what i'm talking about there   in this video what's up everyone i'm brad welcome

comment down below uh come join the community here   because we're having a lot of fun with this thing 
we're making some money too so let me show you   what i'm talking about on microsoft okay so this 
is the candle that we put in on friday right here   um it was like i said it was only less than half 
a percent while you know some of the other big   tech stocks were up more than that like apple was 
up a percent and a half it was actually a kind of   a mixed bag with the big tech actually now that 
i'm looking at it right netflix down two and a   half percent probably because uh you know coming 
off of a massive update on its earnings yep there   it is just doing just doing a little consolidating 
after it's our massive earnings report that's all   uh and then some of the other ones are you 
know it's kind of a mixed bag but let's talk   about microsoft here because this candle here 
is super important all right you can see i've   got these two blue lines drawn and now that we've 
talked about it a little bit i'm going to zoom out   just to give you guys an idea of what the chart 
pattern is that i'm talking about here okay so   let's go ahead and zoom out a little bit so we can 
see the full stock chart pattern this pattern goes   all the way back to september of 2020 okay this 
is a massive consolidation phase on microsoft and   i've been waiting for it to break out underneath 
one of these blue lines or above one of these blue   lines and it finally did we have a breakout above 
this resistance level on the microsoft chart which   suggests it is going to continue higher right 
because this is a consolidation phase coming   off of a bull run uh earlier in 2020 let's back 
up even further you can see we had this big bull   trend this big bull run right all the way through 
2020 i mean we're going almost straight up here   right and then we enter this consolidation phase 
right price is just kind of chopping sideways   pretty big swings at first and then smaller swings 
and smaller swings and smaller and we're creating   this cone shape until you get to the point 
where it has to break out of one of these right   at some point it's going to break out above this 
blue line or below this blue line we just had to   wait and see which one was going to happen well we 
got a breakout above the resistance above the top   that suggests that this pattern wants to continue 
what was happening before it we have a bull run   a bull trend a consolidation phase typically 
continues whatever trend was happening before the   consolidation phase more often than not not always 
no this stuff isn't a hundred percent you know   but uh more often than not it wants to continue 
whatever was happening before the consolidation   phase so we have a bull run before the 
consolidation phase so this consolidation   phase is suggesting hey it's probably going to 
break out to the upside and look at that sure   enough it did so now that we have that breakout 
what do we do about it what does it mean you know   we it doesn't matter if we can't do anything 
about it right well we can we can set a price   target we can project where we think this stock is 
going to go based on the size of the consolidation   channel okay so look what we have here we have 
this really wide opening of this consolidation   channel and then it starts to funnel down and 
then break out we use the width the height of   the consolidation channel at its first touch point 
right here i'm going to use that height to project   the price target for microsoft going forward okay 
so let's go ahead and do that right now let's get   our ruler start down at the bottom boom measure 
up to the top you get 37 and 30 cents of uh width   the width of that consolidation phase 37.30 so we 
come over here to our breakout and we add 37.30   if we think that's where the breakout starts 
which looks pretty good we add 37 all right   that looks pretty good right there we get 
a price target of 263 dollars on microsoft   all right what does that mean well microsoft 
is currently trading at 225 dollars   so you're talking about you know like we just 
said 37 of upside but you know you're trading   at 225 you're targeting 263. it's a pretty good 
chunk of change you could make there's a 16 and   a half percent upside on microsoft that this 
consolidation phase is suggesting let's get our   line on there so it's kind of a little bit more 
permanent okay now we've got our line on there so   we won't forget it so does that mean there's 
definitely going to be 16 of gains on microsoft   in the near future no it does not this is a 
projection based on a probability that it's   going to uh head in that direction right this 
is not a guaranteed thing we're just playing   the odds here that more often than not after a 
breakout above the resistance in a consolidation   phase coming off of a bull run that we hit 
that price target more often than not okay   we need to watch for a few things going forward 
though and those few things are one a head fake   what's a head fake a head fake is when you get 
a candle or two to close above that resistance   and you think you're good to go so 
you enter that trade and then it just   cuts to the downside right there right you get 
a couple of candles that that close above the   resistance and then it drops back down in so be 
careful of that right i would suggest setting   a stop loss i always recommend stop losses 
if you're going to enter trades like this   if they're going to be swing trades where you're 
at you you're not investing long term on a stock   you always should be using stop losses to minimize 
your risk okay so if you enter a trade at say 228   dollars you set your stop loss to just below this 
resistance line so if it does break down into that   channel it auto sells for you okay you don't even 
have to worry about it you have to think about it   it just does it for you so that 
you're not stuck holding that   stock as it continues to drop all right so i 
definitely recommend a stop loss always on these   swing trades so that's one thing to watch out for 
is that head fake another thing to watch out for   this earnings report right here microsoft reports 
earnings on january 26 and that is unpredictable   we don't know what is going to happen with 
the price action after an earnings report   that's a fundamental play right these stock chart 
patterns are technical analysis they're they're   it's a technical way of uh trading stocks 
whereas earnings reports are fundamental   and they are unpredictable so i don't normally 
recommend trading stocks through earnings calls   so i'm just pointing that out to you guys hey 
there's an earnings call coming on 26 january um   so you might want to wait until after that 
earnings call to enter this trade that said   that earnings call could do something crazy 
to this stock chart where we just you know   it just kind of invalidates this pattern so 
it might not make sense to enter that trade   anymore after that earnings call because the uh 
the price action could get a little crazy right   there right if they uh if investors really like 
what they hear on the earnings call this stock   this stock could just shoot up through the roof 
if they don't like what they hear on the earnings   call it could drop right or anything in between 
it could just chop sideways so i would wait until   after the earnings call and then reassess what the 
chart looks like and then real quick i just want   to talk about some of the other big tech fang 
stocks because whenever i make a video about   one of them i want to just briefly discuss some 
of the other ones because i do think a lot of them   move in unison sometimes on some of these 
swings right not all the time but these big   these big tech stocks are just so big 
and they're in these massive index funds   and these massive institutional investors buy 
and sell all of them together that it's enough   power to kind of move them together sometimes 
so looking at facebook real quick it broke down   under a similar consolidation phase but it's 
starting to trend back up it's getting there   right it's getting there see what happens 
there apple has a cup and handle and uh   you know we are getting really close to breaking 
above that lid which is so important for a cup   and handle that is the buy point once you 
have a candle close above that lid line   that's where you enter your trade so if apple has 
one more green day it's going to close above that   above that uh lid and it's going to be 
a valid entry point for a cup and handle   trade and we would be targeting 170 on apple so 
that's we are very close to entering a trade on   apple i'll make another video on that if we 
uh if we get there tesla has this little tiny   uh bull pennant going on i don't know that 
we've broken out of it yet but if we do   we would be targeting why did i say tiny i 
mean we would be targeting eleven hundred   dollars and fifteen eleven we would be 
targeting over eleven hundred dollars if we   break out over this uh bull pennant resistance 
right here so not a tiny bullpen it just looked   tiny at first yeah so we would be targeting some 
pretty high upside here on tesla if that happened   what do you guys think of my uh stock 
chart art i mean this kind of looks like   i don't know what does that look like to you 
it's kind of a strange picture i don't know   um anyway let's move on to some of the other 
big tech what do we got going on here amazon   all right amazon has a what do you think it is 
a consolidation phase shocker right all of these   big tech stocks are entering the end of their 
consolidation phases we're gonna start seeing some   some breakouts facebook was the first one it broke 
down under the consolidation phase but like i said   it was uh getting close to getting back into 
it and now look where amazon is it's at the top   of the consolidation phase it hit that touch point 
and bounced right down off of it so perfectly you   love to see it but what i would love to see 
even more if it would just break out above   that resistance so we could enter a trade here 
and target some massive gains on on amazon i   mean we're talking upwards of forty three hundred 
dollars almost on amazon if it could just break   out above that resistance so uh really love to 
see what's going on there um you know we'll see   if it can break above that resistance uh netflix 
reported crazy good earnings i guess i don't know   um i'm not big into the fundamentals but this 
big gap up right here was on their earnings call   and it's just been kind of consolidating since so 
that might end up being a bull flag or a bullpen   and we'll just have to uh kind of wait and see 
what happens there and then the last of the big   tech fang stocks is google um they also popped 
to the upside on netflix's earnings call so um   it seems like this one is kind of moving in unison 
with netflix right now and then you see these two   little consolidation candles just like netflix had 
those two little consolidation candles right so   pretty similar stuff going on there but google 
broke out of a channel that would that it was in   when it moved with netflix so pretty interesting 
that it was in this channel right here it's coming   off of a pretty big run up entered a channel and 
then boom blasted right out of that channel so   pretty interesting there that it is 
moving almost lockstep with netflix   and those two are moving differently than 
the other big tech stocks it does seem to see   there does seem to be a little bit of divergence 
there okay so that's all i've got for the big tech   stocks and for microsoft in this video targeting 
some pretty good upside potential on microsoft   i hope you guys liked it i think we've got 16 and 
a half percent i think it was of upside potential   on microsoft um and i threw in a couple of 
caveats there that i need you guys to watch   out for with this trade like the earnings report 
and a possible head fake so make sure you guys put   your stop losses into these trades if you are 
trading this stuff and i should say if you are   trading this stuff i am not a financial advisor 
so please do not make these trades based off of   uh what you are seeing in this video solely alone 
this is just my opinion it's for entertainment   purposes only i have been doing this for 15 years 
and i have been successful but i cannot give you   official financial advice so uh don't sue me bro

62,T4vdvlgfAhM," Microsoft was basically reinvented back
in 2014 by its new CEO Satya Nadella and it has been in a massive comeback mode
even though it took a hit in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it's stock price has actually been able to completely wash out the losses and it
reached a new all-time high on June 10th 2020 now the question is will the stock
price go back down again so that we can buy at a cheaper price or did we miss
the boat in today's video I'm going to analyze the Microsoft stock price from
five points of my signature Invest Diva Diamond Analysis which
includes fundamentals market sentiment technicals how it fits with different
risk tolerance levels and overall how it fits within your portfolio we're going
to find out what the future holds for the Microsoft stock price what type of
investor can consider adding Microsoft to their portfolio and of course whether
or not I'm invested in the Microsoft stock we are going to cue in the intro
and while we do that head over to the comments section and tell me which
product do you use most commonly Microsoft products or Apple? let's go hey guys I'm Kiana Danial 3-time
author and the founder of the Invest Diva Movement, the March to jump on to take control of
your financial future and to make your money work for you
Microsoft has long been on my top long-term hold list within my Invest Diva

and register your seed for my next upcoming free masterclass where I teach
you how you can take control of your financial future and how you can make
your money work for you the right way Microsoft has continued its string of
impressive quarters even during the COVID 19 pandemic with meaningful
upside to the revenue their operating margin and their earnings per share what
I like the most about Microsoft though is that it has become one of two public
cloud providers they can deliver a wide variety of paas and IaaS solutions at
scale they're basically different variations of Microsoft at this point
there is a Microsoft that many of you know and use on a daily basis with
products including Microsoft 365 Microsoft Office Windows outlook Word
onedrive among all these other things but then there's a Microsoft that you
may not know much about including Microsoft ai and Microsoft Azure which is their cloud computing service Morningstar believes a Azure is
the centerpiece of the new Microsoft and that it has several distinct advantages
including the fact that it offers customers a painless way to experiment
and move select workloads to the clouds Microsoft has a market cap of over one
point four seven trillion dollars it pays a tiny bit of dividend 1.08 percent
yield it already paid its dividends for this quarter on May 20th and their
earnings is coming up mid-july seeking alpha is rating
Microsoft as neutral at the moment Morningstar has given it three stars and
Benzinga's market sentiment remains neutral as well with almost 77% positive
rating now let's take a look at Microsoft chart this is all my analysis in
the past few years for Microsoft on our Premium Investing Group so let's start out by
looking at the monthly charge so as you can see Microsoft started out strong had
an all-time high then it kind of dived down they had years of consolidation
between 2000 and 2014 when as we mentioned before the company reinvented
itself and then it became a growth stock it reached the all-time high level of
$198 on June 10th 2020 and since then it's been bouncing up and down to see if
it can break above this all-time high level or not now while this is an all
time high level that was recently reached we could also consider this a
double top formation if this resistance level is not able to be broken above but
long-term and due to the wide economic mode of Microsoft I believe that we can
at least expect the prices 210 227 and 238 to be reached in the medium term
these are Fibonacci retracement levels respectively with the last one being the
most importantly from that retracement level of 50% well of course I cope with
19 provided an unexpected drop to the Microsoft price but let's see if we had
other dips during Microsoft's price action in the past so for example in
2018 we did have a dip over here after it reached an all-time high level of 116
it pulled back a little bit just to go back up and create further future highs
had a consolidation in 2019 over here and then we gained energy and reach a
new all-time high at 190 we had another period of consolidation in 2016 actually
here in 2016 2015 period there was a lot of talking and
price but overall it has maintained its growth position so basically we want to
find out right now is that now that it is reached a new all-time high is this
the actual all-time high or is it gonna go up to 210 which is a level that I
identified back in February 2020 well based on past performance Microsoft is
not one to really form double top chart patterns and its business even if we
consider a second wave of COVID 19 Microsoft Business doesn't really get
impacted by economy being shut in a shutdown because a lot of people who are
using Microsoft will continue to use Microsoft regardless the losses that we
saw in february/march was basically the Microsoft stock price writing the
downturn wave on the other hand Wall Street Journal announced that we are
definitely are in a recession at the moment so let's take a look and see how
Microsoft stock price actually acted back in 2008 now that is before their
new CEO had taken over so the recession did impact the Microsoft stock price we
did have a double top chart pattern over here and it completed it went to
consolidation mode and then started to go back up in 2013 but we may not be
able to rely on that chart right now because the management and the CEO have
changed so I'm going to monitor this potential double top chart pattern for
the next week or so and see if the price can actually break above it and if it
can't then obviously we have missed the boat and the price is going to jump up
now the good thing is that for every time that Microsoft price does reach an
all-time high we do see a temporary pullback anyway and if the pullback
starts right now right here then based on the Fibonacci retracement analysis we
could expect the price to go back down to one of these support levels at 177
168 and 161 if the price reaches 210 before the pullback then we have to redo
our Fibonacci retracement level find new support levels potentially the new
support level after that is going to be at around 192
anyway because this is the current resistance that is going to turn into
support in the future now who is a Microsoft stock for because it doesn't
really pay a high dividend yield this wouldn't be work for somebody who's
in their retirement years who are looking for income with their investment
strategy at this price if you're buying today Microsoft will definitely be
considered the perfect opportunity for somebody who is younger who is looking
for long term growth in their portfolio in my opinion
I personally am invested in the Microsoft stock and I started investing
in it a long time ago now if I didn't have any Microsoft stocks I would
probably consider starting to invest in it by setting buy limit orders at these
key support levels and monitor this double top chart pattern I would keep
the Microsoft stock for at least a year before I take profit and if you already
have Microsoft and you want to start taking partial profit these are the
levels that you can consider for profit taking 210, 227 and 238 that does it
for my opinion about the Microsoft stock and its price action now I'd love to hear
from you are you currently invested in the Microsoft stock? head over to the
comment section and let me know as always thank you so much for tuning in

63,foqswJT3Spc," - Some of the world's largest
companies have dominated stock market returns in recent history. For the five years ending July, 2020 an equal weighted portfolio
of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla more than quadrupled in value, leaving a total market index fund investor in the dust. Who knew beating the
market could be so easy. I'm Ben Felix, Portfolio
Manager at PWL Capital. In this episode of Common Sense Investing, I'm going to tell you what we can learn from the recent returns
of the world's biggest and most exciting companies. (upbeat music) The stock market can be sorted into nine broad categories based on size and relative price. Company size is measured
by market capitalization, the total value of a
company's outstanding shares. Relative price is measured
by the company's price relative to some fundamental
measure like its book value or earnings. Value stocks have low prices
relative to their fundamentals while growth stocks have high prices. The five biggest companies
in the US market, Facebook, Apple, Amazon,
Alphabet and Microsoft currently make up nearly 20% of the US stock markets' value and Apple alone makes up around 6%. These are huge companies with high prices, also known as a large cap growth stocks. Between their unbelievable recent returns and their world changing
products and services, it is easy to believe that
this time is different and that these are the only
stocks that you need to own. Well, it may seem like
uncharted territory, it's actually nothing new. From 1927 through 1979, it was not unusual to have
the largest company makeup around 6% of the US stock markets value. General Motors, AT&T and IBM took turns over that time period
as the largest company in the US market, routinely surpassing
Apple's current 6% weight. The story is similar for
the historical contribution of the largest five and
largest 10 companies to the US markets total value. All right, so these companies
aren't unusually huge relative to market history, but the network effects infinite scale and ever increasing data
advantage that today's biggest companies have,
does seem unprecedented. But consider this, in the 1930s AT&T was the largest US company. Alexander Graham Bell had
invented the telephone in 1876 and by 1885 his
company began to build out the telephone network. Think about that for a moment. Telephones did not exist until this company started
creating them and they built and owned the telephone network. AT&T quickly became and
remained the most valuable US company for decades. Other innovative companies
have similarly grown to and maintained tremendous
size and dominance for decades. Massive companies like General Motors which created the electric
car starter, airbags and the automatic transmission
and General Electric which made electric lighting mainstream, have played crucial roles
in shaping the world that we live in today, but
that has not necessarily made them good long-term investments. For each decade, starting 1930, 1940, 1950 and so on through 2010,
the 10 largest companies at the start of the decade have made up on average 23.6% of
the US stock market. The average annual returns
of those 10 largest companies for the following decade
has trailed the market by an annualized 1.51% on average. To understand why massive successful world changing companies can
trail the stock market, let's consider where
stock returns come from. There are two primary components, the expected return and
the unexpected return. A stock's value is theoretically
the discounted price that the market is willing to pay for the company's expected future profits. The expected stock return
is the discount rate applied to those expected future profits. If you expect a company to
deliver some level of profits and you buy those expected
profits at a 7% discount, you expect to earn a 7%
return on your investment. The unexpected stock return comes from new previously unknown
information that gets included in the price when it becomes known. For example, a company releasing earnings that are much better than
expected may result in its price increasing to reflect
now higher expectations for future profits. An unexpected pandemic might
have the opposite effect. When it comes to long-term
investing it is not possible to predict the unexpected
portion of returns. So I think it's pretty sensible to focus on the expected return. Companies like Facebook, Apple,
Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla are not only huge,
they also have high prices relative to their fundamental
financial measures. When I say high, I mean high,
the relative price of US large cap growth stocks
is always going to be high compared to the overall
market based on growth stocks being by definition, the most expensive stocks in the market. But the current level of expensiveness for these companies is
looking a lot like it did at the beginning of 2000,
which was followed by a decade of negative returns for US
large cap growth stocks. That anecdote makes sense when we again consider where expected
stock returns come from. High relative prices
reflect some combination of low discount rates
and high expectations for future profits. If these companies deliver on the markets exceptionally
high expectations, that is they don't exceed
them or fail to meet them all else equal, they should
deliver on the expected return of the large cap growth asset class. For these companies to continue delivering unexpectedly good stock returns, they will need to deliver
financial results that are better than the already high
expectations that the market has set for them. Betting that this will happen is a bet against what the aggregate market expects. A bet that can pay off
sometimes, but usually doesn't. If we can agree that betting
on unexpected returns doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I know that's a big if. We need to turn our focus
to the expected returns of the large cap growth asset class. Large cap growth stocks have historically delivered lower average
returns than smaller and cheaper stocks over most time periods in the US and around the world. That statement is supported
by the Academic Literature, in their landmark 1992 paper
in the Journal of Finance, Eugene Fama and Kenneth
French documented the evidence that larger companies
have lower average returns than smaller companies and more expensive companies
have lower average returns than less expensive companies. From a theoretical perspective,
there are two ways to think about the historical under-performance of large cap growth stocks. If we take the view that
markets are rational, that is investors rationally assign a reasonable expectations
for future profits then differences in
expected returns are based on differences in risk. Given a level of expected
profits, a company that is viewed as less risky will have
a lower discount rate and therefore a higher price. If we take the view that
markets are not always rational, the lower average returns
of the most expensive stocks could be explained by investors
irrationally extrapolating the high growth of successful
firms too far into the future, leading to their prices rising
higher than what the business fundamentals could ever
reasonably justify. When the prices eventually correct back to something more reasonable, they drag investor returns down with them. In a 2012 paper titled
""Identifying Expectation Errors in Value/Glamor Strategies of
Fundamental Analysis Approach"" Joseph Piotrowski and Eric So, take the irrational pricing view, documenting evidence
that the glamor effect of high priced stocks underperforming is related to a reversal
of erroneous expectations, where expectations in
the price are incongruent with current trends in
firms' fundamentals. They also find that
this effect is strongest during periods of high investor sentiment. Cliff Asness the founder
of AQR Capital Management wrote in May, 2020, about
how wide the valuation spread between expensive and
cheap stocks had gotten. At that time the price to book spread, that is the ratio of how
expensive growth stocks are relative to value stocks was as wide as it has been
for the past 50 years. Now it's important to consider here that this might be reasonable
if today's expensive companies are truly
increasingly better businesses than their less expensive counterparts. In the language of Piotrowski and So, if the expectations in
the price are congruent with the current trends
in firm's fundamentals. Cliff showed that this
is simply not the case. The difference in business quality between expensive and cheap stocks measured by gross
profitability, return on assets and debt to equity does not explain the unusually large
spread in relative price. Differences in gross
profitability are currently in line with historical averages. The return on assets for cheap stocks is better than it has been historically, and cheap stocks are less leverage than they've been historically. Okay, gross stocks are
currently extremely expensive relative to history, which means their
expected returns are low, but none of this means that you can't make money by
investing in the next Amazon. The trick is investing in it
before it is one of the world's largest companies, that's
easier said than done. In a 2019 paper titled ""Do Global Stocks Outperform
US Treasury Bills"" The authors demonstrate that
there is an extreme positive skew in individual stock returns. That is most stocks trail the market while an exceptional
few deliver massive returns. More specifically, they
studied nearly 62,000 global common stocks
from 1990 through 2018 and found that 56% of US
stocks and 61% of non US stocks underperformed one month US treasury bills over the full period. Even more striking was the finding, that the top performing
1.3% of firms in the sample was responsible for
the net wealth creation of the entire sample. While the remaining 98.7% of firms collectively matched
the returns of one month US treasury bills. There is a good chance that
today's largest companies made significant contributions
to global net wealth creation on their way to becoming
massive companies. But now that they are there, their expected future
returns are relatively low. Large cap growth stocks have
been on a phenomenal run. Delivering huge unexpected returns and the biggest most well-known companies have been front and center. As hard as it may be to ignore that hype, betting on future unexpected
returns is a gamble, and based on the huge
positive skew in stock returns it's a gamble with a
negative expected outcome. The theory and evidence strongly suggests that the expected returns of
large cap growth companies as an asset class including the companies that are shaping the
world trail the market. With no way to predict what
will do well in the short run, either at the individual stock level or the asset class level. The best thing that we
can do is consistently own the entire market.. Value and growth, large and
small and everything in between, which we can do very easily using low cost total market index funds. If you need more excitement than that starting with the market and then adding some extra
weight to value stocks or better yet small cap value stocks, is a much more statistically reliable bet than following the crowd
into large cap growth stocks. Thanks for watching. My name is Ben Felix of PWL Capital and this is Common Sense Investing. If you enjoyed this video,

64,bXUyEwhdD9s," hello let's talk about microsoft 
everybody's heard of microsoft   so let's take a look at what they are up to 
lately and whether or not it's worth buying   right now i've spent a lot of time doing the 
research if you watch the entire video i'll show   you the full analysis i'll go over the recent 
news and financial strengths with you as well   as what i think is a good price range to buy so 
that you can get in at a good price you not only   want a good stock pick you also want to buy them 
at the right price you can see for yourself that   my recent alerts of ibp and moderna have turned 
significant gains please consider subscribing just take a look at this steady growth i think 
the chart speaks for itself as to how this is a   slow and steady wins the race type of company 
the growth looks to be most likely steady upwards   i think we can infer this from the chart 
before we even look at its financials   another interesting point you might like to 
know is how did microsoft perform when the   entire market crashed back in march 2020 it went 
from a peak of 190s to a low of 130s which was   approximately a 30 shave if we go by the weekly 
open and close price 185 to 137 which is a 26   drop during the crash that's not too 
bad at all in fact it held up quite well   considering how much the rest of 
the market dropped at the time   here's another interesting thing about microsoft 
it's been riding an upward trend for a while   in fact it's currently in a technical pattern 
breakout mode i'll show you what i mean it looks   like it's headed toward 264 price range if you 
look at the financials it's gonna convince you   that this is quite a solid company lucky for you 
as of last friday microsoft stock came back down   a bit creating a nice buying opportunity it's 
still in this breakout mode and on its way up   so any dip along this path would be a good time 
to get in the recent stock price growth means the   company now has a 1.6 trillion dollar market 
capitalization some are worried that it may   be a bit pricey but we disagree we are looking 
at microsoft's long-term outlook the financial   strength of microsoft gives us confidence that 
the company still has a lot of room for growth   microsoft's ceo satya nadella had brought 
tremendous growth to microsoft by changing their   core strategy microsoft used to focus more on 
device and hardware when ballmer was at the helm   they had the surface rt debacle and then the 
acquisition of nokia smartphone business which   didn't turn out very well but when the new 
ceo came in the core change was to become   a mobile first and cloud first company nadella 
improved microsoft's existing office iphone app   and within months brought the office app to 
the ipad in retrospect it only made sense   to have those working well on mobile devices 
and the ceo's mobile first approach worked out   another core strategic move from microsoft 
was to transform the business model into a   software as a service sas this allowed microsoft 
365 to generate a more consistent revenue stream   this contributed to their growth even to this 
day in fiscal year 2020 microsoft reported an   annual revenue growth of the productivity and 
business processes segment of 13 the microsoft   office subscriptions model had been working 
so well that the growth can be seen even now   the software as a service model didn't end with 
office microsoft's azure cloud service is all the   more proof of microsoft's drive towards software 
as a service the company continues to grow azure   rapidly if you see microsoft's financial growth 
it's easy to see that their future looks bright   microsoft's key success in the past was in 
knowing when to get into markets sure there's   been some flops but you can't bat a home run 
every time you swing but microsoft has been   taking shots and swinging in the right markets 
their expansion into artificial intelligence   and the internet of things iot services and 
products would be proof of the right direction   microsoft is positioned well to reap the rewards 
of their investments into research and development   considering the size of the data and the speed 
of the data of future needs will only be growing   there are tremendous growth opportunities 
for cloud services that microsoft provides   despite microsoft azure being slow to adopt its 
marketplace share compared to amazon web services   microsoft azure has been growing rapidly the 
differentiator for microsoft would be that of   stronger full stack offerings for the end 
users that use their software as a service   and infrastructure as a service this ability to 
offer a complete set of tools that help companies   adopt artificial intelligence and analytics into 
their business processes provide a great advantage   microsoft trades at 35 times earnings which is 
relatively on the high side of their 10-year   historical valuation when you compare this to the 
overall market it's still not all that expensive   microsoft has strong fundamentals good 
business strategy that has proven to work   and also well positioned for the future i 
want you to take a good look at microsoft's   impressively steady annual revenue growth annual 
asset growth and the actual annual earnings   this isn't the estimated but the actual 
earnings growth they've beat the estimates   quite nicely it's easy to see the total 
annual revenue growth being on the uptrend   i'm gonna fast forward the financials to summarize 
for you that it's very solid i can't stress how   great microsoft's financials are you can check 
for yourself that it's on a general uptrend   everything from revenue earnings accumulation of 
asset going back to what we saw in the charts it's   self-explanatory that microsoft's financials more 
than back their steady stock price growth they   aren't even expensive either compared to the other 
tech companies microsoft's price per earnings is   actually not much different from what it was back 
in 2018. i think this is a bargain and a must have   stock in your portfolio if you haven't bought 
this already well that's all for today if you   enjoyed watching this video please smash the like

and we’re gonna do it all in 90 seconds… You wanna keep up with stocks but you don’t
have the time to read a lengthy report on every company that interests you. You’re busy, I get it. I respect that. So, I took the most important considerations
from my research and packed it into 90 seconds. Use this to decide if it’s worth your time

services, devices, and solutions. As of this recording, MSFT has market cap
of $885B and a price per share of $115. So, should you grab yourself a couple shares? That is the question… Here are several reasons you might want buy
Microsoft: Microsoft is a hybrid growth, dividend stock
which means the Company has a bright future ahead of them, while having the capability
to pay out consistently, increasing dividends. In terms of growth potential, Microsoft is
classified as a high growth stock due to its earnings potential of over 20%. Under the leadership of Satya Nadella, the
company has become more nimble and customer-centric, transitioning out of their PC era and increasing
revenue from its diversified business segments However, its most notable revenue generator
is its Intelligent Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, which grew 89% this fiscal year. Microsoft Azure owns more market share in
the cloud computing space than Amazon, Oracle, IBM, and Salesforce. This past fiscal year, Microsoft returned
$5.3 billion to shareholders, which is up 16% YoY. All this and the dividend coverage ratio is
still 1.3x. And as mentioned earlier, earnings are expected
to continue to increase. But here are some reasons NOT to own Microsoft:
Valuing Microsoft’s intrinsic value by discounted future cash flows suggests the stock already
has future potential factored into its share price, with a fair value of $66 and a PE multiple
of 53. These metrics suggest that if the stock market
were to crash, just like Alibaba and many of these other large growth companies today,
shareholders shouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft falls faster than the rest of the market. In addition, Microsoft is competing with the
toughest companies in the tech industry right now, most notably the FANG stocks. Microsoft can’t afford to make mistakes. … So what do you say: buy or no buy? Does Microsoft’s future growth potential
and steady dividend justify its relatively high valuation? I look forward to continuing this discussion

66,Seuw9KjDxME," Hey YouTube. I'm Jimmy and this video I'm going to walk
through my analysis of Microsoft ticker symbol MSFT. This is the 20th video in our series where we're analyzing all 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. What the ultimate goal of taking all of that analysis and building three different
portfolios a value a growth and a dividend you could see a link to all of those videos in the
description below. So Microsoft is a technology company that breaks your business into three
main segments. They have productivity and business processes Intelligent Cloud and more personal computing. And as we could see they're actually
fairly spread out when it comes to a
revenue perspective. The largest is more personal
computing and that's got about 38 percent of
revenue. This segment is where they book
revenue for their Windows products. And then they have devices like
their surface laptops Surface Pro things like that. They also have x box both the
hardware and the software. Something like x box live. Then the next largest segment is productivity and business processes. That accounts for about 33 percent
of revenue in this segment Microsoft has all
other office products including Office 365. They also have Skype one drive all the revenue they generate from
owning LinkedIn. They also have their Dynamics
Business Solutions products and then they have their smallest
segment which is their intelligent cloud. This segment consists of their cloud and server products. The key product in this segment is
Microsoft Azure Azure is similar to Amazon's AWS. In fact it's the second largest public cloud service behind only AWS. And this brings us to an interesting
point about Microsoft and that is if you think about it Azure is behind AWS as Bing is behind Google. And for me this could be both a
positive thing and a negative thing. Microsoft has a couple big
components of their business that is second best. You could say on one hand that
there's plenty of upside on the other hand
you could say there's an enormous competitor in their way. They may never get to be number one. So it's just something to keep in
the back of our minds. Now Windows 10 is doing quite well
for Microsoft. So it's going to be tough for
competitors to knock them out of that position. So now let's look at some numbers and see if Microsoft is worth
investing in. So here's a chart of revenue and the green bars are estimates. And as we could see analysts are
expecting Microsoft revenue to grow nicely in the next couple of years and leading up to 2018. Microsoft has actually done quite
well in recent years. Now as we could see in the most
recent year revenue jumped from about ninety six billion
to 110 billion. That's more than a 14
percent jump. Now if you want to dive a bit closer and we could see where that revenue
came from. Here's a chart of revenue
going back to 2014. This time broken out by percentage of contribution to
revenue by segments as we could see the cloud revenue is getting a bit
bigger each year for the past few years at about 29 percent of revenue. Right now. Meanwhile personal computing is falling. It hit a high of about 46 percent in 2015 and now they're down to 38 percent
as of last year. Now this shift in revenue mix may be a good thing because when we add our operating margins by segment for the end of 2018 and the end of 2018 is actually as of their 2018 ends at the end of June. So their fiscal year runs June to June just there where they
just finished their first quarter recently. But either way when we add our
operating margins we could see that more personal
computing is only 25 percent. In fact that's the smallest of the
three segments. When we look at the other two
segments Well they're both getting larger from a
percentage basis and their margins are better. This should make a good case for Microsoft margins continuing to get stronger. Now moving over to earnings per
share we could see that earnings per share looks
very similar to the way revenue looked. So it seems that Microsoft is
rolling along nicely when it comes to both revenue and profits. Now before we get into valuing
Microsoft stock let's look at some key points. So recently Microsoft bought a company called GitHub. GitHub is a software development
platform this acquisition helps promote Microsoft's management's belief that over the long term software development will be key for the long
term success of any business. So they hope to remain a staple in all businesses going forward. Now one more thing I want
to point out is when Microsoft's new CEO took over his name is Satya Nadella. He took over. If we jump back to the revenue chart
we could see he took over in 2014. He replaced Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft. And since then it appears that he's been shifting the business towards a more growth like company and he's trying to set up the company to dominate for the future. The fact that they're gradually
shifting towards better margin businesses I think could be a very good
indicator that he seems to be doing a good
job. Plus look at the revenue chart. Since then he's really started to
pick up pace and analysts have him expecting to continue to do OK so now would
valuation method do we think would be best to
value Microsoft stock so PE would probably the most popular
one and that would probably work well
here since they're a fairly stable
company and I doubt that profits will be compromised anytime over the
long run. So my personal favorite is of course discounted cash flow. So what I'm thinking is that we
tried both see how they shake out and then try to come up with ultimately what we believe is
the best move with Microsoft. Does it belong in one of our
portfolios. And if you can stick around for the
discounted cash flow valuation because I'm actually going
to do something a little different this time that
I've done in some of the other videos where we use DCF. So let's start with PE for me finding peers from Microsoft might be a bit
tricky because they have so many different
businesses. Google is a good competitor when it
comes to Bing Amazon's a good competitor with Azure. Apple is a good competitor. While Apple is a big competitor in a
lot of different ways. So for me it makes a lot of sense to
use Microsoft's own historical PE averages and then try to come up with what we think is the best one
to use going forward. So right now Microsoft's current forward PE is about 21 x. It's actually about twenty one and a half X but either way. Call it 21 X their one year average is 24 x their three year average is about 22 X and their five year average is
about 19 x. So which one should we use. Well since it seems that growth is
picking up in the past few years I think it makes sense to use the three year
average since this would account for the fact that things have started to
pick up from Microsoft. If we use the five year average we
might pick up part of what we'll call the
transition period for management since they just took
over in 2014. So if we're gonna use a three year
average. Well we need a forward PE. Let's take the 22 X we multiply that by the expected earnings per
share and that's about four dollars and ninety six cents according to
analyst estimates. That gives us a fair
value of about one hundred nine dollars. Okay so we have a hundred nine
dollars with PE. Now let's look at
discounted cash flow. Okay. So now to come up the fair
value using discounted cash flow from Microsoft stock I'm going to try to use the multi-stage discounted cash flow valuation
model. Basically what that means is I'm
going to break their growth into different stages. So the first stage I'm going to take a growth rate of 14 percent to get that number I took I simply took the average of the past two
years and the next year projections
averaged them out came out of the simple
average of 14 percent. Now if we take that 14 percent and we apply it to the next three
years of free cash flow. So we have each year grow by 14
percent. That brings us to our second stage in that stage we're going to assume a growth rate of 7 percent. Where did I get 7 percent. Frankly it's half of 14. Because ultimately what I'm trying
to do is instead of a typical just kind of cash flow
valuation that we typically do what we do is
we say OK you have growth rate of 14 percent and then the next day or the next year whenever it is it
drops immediately down to our perpetual growth rate. So for our case we're going to use a
perpetual growth rate of 2.5 percent. So now we have high growth of 14 percent. Then it drops for a couple
of years at 7 percent and then it hits our perpetual
growth rate. Now another way to do this is you
can have Phase 1 where it grows at a certain period
then a transition period and then it tapers off into your perpetual
growth rate. But again to that another video. So after growing free cash flow by 7 percent for a few years we end up at
2025. Now we assume each of these stages lasted three years and there's no hard and fast rule
for how many years each stage should last. I stuck with three years because I
feel like three years is an easier number to project
I could project out three years more
confidently than I could protect our let's say five and then after another stage would
be 10 years and 15 years that could get a bit
complicated. Now typically what we've got is we want our research to drive our projections and what it might be. So before pretend you had a pharmaceutical company that was going to grow revenue by 15 percent a year and then in year 5 they lose their patent and you expect it to drop off
quickly. Well you could adjust this type of
model would be perfect for that you'd adjust it
down from whatever the percentages down to whatever you believe the
perpetual growth rate is from there. Okay. But now focusing on Microsoft now we
actually apply a perpetual growth rate to our free cash flow. So what that means is that from 2026 forward Microsoft will grow forever. In our case at 2.5 percent. That being said this is actually a three stage discounted cash flow valuation method. The yellow section is the first
stage than the bottom section is Stage 2. Then the perpetual growth rate. Well that's the final stage. So now all we need to do is convert
Microsoft's free cash flow to a present value. We do that by dividing that by our discount factor. In our case we're going to use a
weighted average cost of capital of eight point five percent. That's in blue. And basically what do as we take our 1 plus our eight point five percent. Then we raise it to the power of whatever time period right. So for 2019 it's one plus eight point five percent raise to
the power of one. And since that's only one time
period way right now you could see it as one
point zero nine. But that's only that's a rounding
thing if I had Excel round to three decimal places it
would be showing 1.085. Then in 2020 it's 1.085 raise to the power of 2. And so on right down the right down
the line then all we have to do is we take our projected free cash flow divided by our discount factor and we end up with the present
value. Add those all up we end up with a fair value. Today all we have to do is divide that by the number of shares
outstanding. And that shows us that our fair
value is 80 dollars per share according to our discounted cash flow
valuation. So this is a chart from Microsoft
stock going back over the past year. And based on our own PE valuation which was about one hundred nine
dollars and our discounted cash flow was about eighty dollars. Well we landed right about in the middle of that right
now that's about where Microsoft is trading. So called into our calculations it looks at Microsoft. Looks like Microsoft is somewhat
fairly valued. Now personally I really like Microsoft. I like the growth potential of
Microsoft. I think that Microsoft likely belongs in our growth portfolio because it's possible that their free cash flow ends up
being better than this over the long run. It's also possible that they get valued higher simply because they become more of a growth
company and the market has a way of favoring
growth companies. So for me this is a tricky one. I really like the company but they seem somewhat fairly
valued. I would at the early stages before we go ahead and build the portfolio. I like the idea of putting them in
the growth portfolio value portfolio probably only
belongs there if it falls even more dividend portfolio probably not they
have a dividend yield of less than 2 percent. So I'm not sure belongs there but what do you think. Does Microsoft belong in any of our
portfolios. Let me know what you think of the

[Music] if you are feeling like that you are a donkey i'm feeling so pummed and so pumped i'm gonna sell everything and buy more tesla i'm serious you know like [ __ ] everything else i invested in i'm selling all i have a high degree of certainty that tesla stock will ten times but first hold your chickens of course i'm not going to sell everything now and buy i'm telling you exactly how i'm going to do it later so what happened during this whole earnings call that made me so sure that this will be the right move i don't know about you i listened to every tesla earnings call and this earnings call it is the best earnings call ever three things that happened that made me feel that this tesla stock was back in the 2018 days where i knew this this is it i'm getting the same feeling again i'm like trying really hard to hold my chickens this is it seriously number one the first time i heard elon musk talk about evaluations of tesla in a proper manner elon in the past have always tweeted about tesla stock is too high he's probably tweeted this six times and for the first time in history elon said tesla is undervalued [Applause] the level of stoics man i'm feeling this high man let me play the clip i'll link the entire conference call below you know how does one justify the value of the company being where it is you know if tesla's ships let's say hypothetically um 50 or 60 billion dollars worth of vehicles and those vehicles become full self-driving and can be used in a rubber taxi the utility uh increases from an average of 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week so that's like roughly a 5x increase in utility um and if there was a case then you have to get 20 pe on that it's like a trillion dollars to me elon is being pretty conservative here applying such a low multiple a pe 20 hey come on man what the hell it is 20 21 not 1980s and this is a big hint from the man himself you know that he is an internet troll dropping hints all the time the success of full self driving is my investment thesis that tesla will hit 4 trillion in 10 years i'm beginning to think that i'm too conservative on a timeline and execution and that brings me to point number two you look how tesla managed to 10x from 50 billion to 500 billion they did it by proving that they are able to scale even though tesla can deliver 10 to 20 million cars a year in the future tesla is already 800 billion dollar company and it's priced in is fair value so how do you go from 800 billion to a few trillion the answer is full self driving in this earnings call i've never seen the entire like call or team so confident with fsd we've seen 1000 plus fsd beta users posting videos including my good friend vincent i'll link his channel below i watch others too my target for full self driving to work was 2025 while most people were saying it was 20 30 including some ai experts [ __ ] man it's going to be this year with fsd the utility of the car is going to at least 5x bringing the cost of transportation down the last cars on the road and imagine tesla taking a 20 to 30 revenue of each trip and the rest goes to the owner there will be so much revenue generated fsd enables robo taxis which is a multi-trillion dollar market cap by itself and on top of that tesla is in talks with other auto makers to license fsd can you imagine that [ __ ] the amount of cars running around with asset fsds guys this is it man this year once the world finds out when it works the stock price will start to search and as always i'm usually in before the search so point number three elon made it clear that he will continue as ceo because he got a lot more goals to achieve and thank god he made that decision during his trip to hawaii he met larry edison and larry must have thrown my donkey at him in fact i made a video about this and i'll link it up here so his position as ceo is still good so how am i going to position my portfolio i'll start selling my other positions the only position i wouldn't touch is my bitcoin hatch you know just a quick note elon tweeted in retrospect it was inevitable and he changed his description at the same time just an hour ago on the clubhouse app he just mentioned this he got to watch his works because it could cause market movement and he just said that bitcoin is a good thing i give it a 69 chance tesla will convert some of tesla's cash balance to bitcoin just like square and micro strategy cash is snow mocking the dilution and inflation it's crazy for my portfolio everything has to go from rg actc ipoe bra and including square and lemonade not gme because diamond hands this is my middle finger to the tesla shot seeking some justice for elon gme is a position i'm okay to go zero gme is not for profits please take note there's nothing wrong fundamentally in the businesses that i'm letting go you can continue holding on if you want for me square has 5x from where i bought it at 40 the half it was half a million position so i need to slowly trim it laminate has two to three times rg has 2x ipo is up mostly in profits i'm shifting my focus back into tesla i don't see it any other way i'm not selling of course like all at once i'll use the charts to plan my exit when i sell i prefer to update on twitter because it's much faster my last update was selling ipoe to buy tesla because the stock has just popped up and all the selling will not be done in an instant the more tesla drops the more out and i'll keep you guys updated here and on twitter so guys wrapping up this earnings call is tesla like sandbagging over again tesla has learned the lessons from his past and now under promising so this sandbagging thing is the new tesla if you listen to the small clues you see the big picture that my 4 trillion dollar market cap is going to sound pretty cheap soon anyway i hope you are pumped about tesla remain focused and dollar cost average if the stock price drop and you got extra money else just hold and do nothing appreciate the thumbs up and as always don't invest like uh,TSLA,"['hey', 'chicken', 'gang', 'you', 'know', 'you', 've', 'seen', 'my', 'portfolio', 'before', 'mostly', 'tesla',

68,LIcp-Q2wYHs," Welcome back to the watch list. I'm Tom White filling in for Nicole Petallides YY's Let's welcome in our next guest, and that's Dan IVZ he's a managing director in equity research at Wedbush. Welcome to show Dan Appreciate it. Now I just received your new note this morning like I wanted to hit on that before we get into Tesla's here a little bit, but it's pretty positive and I think it's going against the grain here a little bit with what we've seen as far as the market moves this year, with the nasty lagging that the other three major indices, you're looking at 25 to 30% Growth. Maybe in that text based give me a run down here in the note. Yeah Good. I believe this pullback that we've seen rotation trade maniacal focus on the 10 Year. It's created would I've used a golden opportunity in terms of the in the secular winners. We believe tech stocks up another 25-30 percent from here. NASDAQ's 16,000. In cloud inside security and five G and I believe one of you in terms of earnings. That's gonna be a major catalyst the tax base. Toso to me. This is really the opportunity to own Secular winners across clouds, cybersecurity in five Jean look, the heaters AR gonna heat if he had the rather tech rally many of them in here the last 3 to 4 years. We continue thing. This is a blip. Rather than the star veteran. Yeah and I think those that rising interest rate environment that has everybody spooked a little bit on this sector as the 10 year yield kind of stabilizes here, You're gonna get these sectors to get more comfortable at these levels as far as the Growth name goes, and we've seen a little bit of movement back into those names. Now you had a couple big names in their with Apple and my krose, along with nuance. Give me the breakdown here an apple because you're expecting a few more iPhones to sell here, Dan Yeah, I mean, the super cycle thesis we've talked about, you know, it's playing out and we've seen across our agent checks. I think March quarter is gonna be Rebus. I think on a trajectory right now. BBA TENSION 242 150 million units Bride wants would beat the record from 2005 with iPhone six. This isn't this is not just a one year cycle. There's a two year cycle going into IVZ 13 as well. 40.7 base is and when they're buy prepared, doctor that combined with the rearing on service. I think a year from now we're looking at $3 trillion mark happen. Apple Yeah, Go to Microsoft. Go ahead. Go ahead, Dan. But but just you're going in the themes. Five geezer APPLETINI, You'll get cloud. Only 35 of the way through on the cloud ship Microsoft has seemed more and more share gains for exams on actually accelerated as your Growth. I believe this is going to be another game changer quarter. Which is why we love that There are third topic is nuance, healthcare Cloud play, re reading in process, I think right now called a loo $40 stock. I think this is a senior citizen. Stock and neck 6-9 months, and we got those price target upside thinking APPLETINI, 75 and Microsoft 2-3 100 s O pretty optimistic going into the end of the year. We'll have to wait and see on those key. One Those earnings that are coming up here at the end of the month, but I don't want to switch back to Tesler now, Dan, because we did have that upgrade that you that you gave earlier this week, $2000 a share your say that China's booming right now What do your estimates here for? Tesla's the evey, although it's a small component of the auto sales, it's growing at a rapid pace here. Get the green tidal wave and I think we're seeing that kicked off last week in the US. With Baden. But if you look at China that that's the linchpin to the both pieces for testimony seeing skyrocket sounds. In China that could be 40 overall go into next year. Combine that with what we're seeing is green tidal wave in Europe in the U. S. Only 3% of automobiles that AR evey Today we think going 10% next 3 to 4 years, and it's not just hassle. GM through the whole ACWI assistant is being built out, But we believe when I look a task, given deliveries and given where we see numbers when you look out, and there's$1000 stock by the end of this year. Yeah. And if you look at that competition, it is starting to heat up, especially over in Europe. Where you know Audi and some of the other names Volkswagen or are certain to ramp up a little bit there. But if you look at, um you know the competition. You know, it's there for the taking, because the space is growing right? And the new Administracion has his green agenda. What do your expectations for the benefits to not only, you know the E V space, but Tesla in general. Yeah I think that that's something that I still don't think is as appreciate and I think in terms of what's happening in the U. S 7500 credits there capped out in terms of passing GM. 2 200,000 ceiling, I think, as part of this infrastructure bill that that gets removed ceiling to do is get restored for passengers and, of course, bring one buying those cars now that was credits care for story, which I think is significant in the U. S. As well as we believe 10-30 $1000 is what we're hearing could be the pride the next level of tax credits, and that's significant because us is wag behind Europe in China. 2% on Lian terms of evey sows, I believe this is some miss come in leg, not just a Tesla. But to the overall ADV eco system. We believe Warren have trillion of the five trillion In evey of next decades. Coming in the U. S. So eco systems gonna be built out? Yeah, And you mentioned that eco system is the fact that Biden his Administracion, one of their key components of this green agenda is getting more charging station and that's always been a concern. As far as the BEVGS space goes, But what's down the road for Tesla? What's next catalyst? Is it going to be the truck? Is it going to be the semi space that could, you know? Maybe propel the stock even higher? Yeah. Then there's two specific cattle is one. I think we're just ultimately as we go through next few quarters numbers that could be the street by 10 15% I think is that plays out That gets full EEM or digesting the stock, But in terms of the drum roll it cyber trunk. I mean, we think we're starting to get too close to 700,000 pre orders. That's gonna be the next leg along with what we're seeing a model. Why models? Essen at this point is noise. Your see some headway on that. And then you take a step back gold age AVVAA, and I think we're looking at houses $1000",TSLA,"['Welcome', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'watch', 'list', 'I', 'm', 'Tom', 'White', 'filling', 'in', 'for',

69,gsBcsElrUq4," Hey welcome everyone! Hey this is my craziest video yet. I am
going to go through 3 different models showing you how insane tesla's share price could be - How crazy
amazing Tesla could change the world, accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, make ridiculous profits and drive the
share price to levels you would not believe. Unbelievable! I don't believe it. I think i'm probably crazy. But the models make sense to me. I'm sure
there are flaws in these models so please go through this video and pick it apart. Yell me in the comments why you think I'm wrong. Get me back to numbers that are
realistic. Because i am going to tell you right now I believe the Tesla share
price in 2030 will be more than 100 000 a share. I
know it's crazy, but check out these models and tell me what you think. Ready? Let's go! I'm going to look at this three different ways. The first way is how a lot of Wall Street and retail investors are looking at Tesla. Looking at vehicle production. Looking at
gross margins. This is what we see from particularly from Hyperchange. I'm
a huge fan of Hyperchange. It's going to be epic! So much to cover anyway.
Let's just get into it. Welcome to the world of Hypercharts.
Here we are with vehicle deliveries ... I think the Wall Street - I think he
too closely mimics the Wall Street analysis approach. 
I love his channel. I love his analysis. And as much of an optimist I think he is,
I think he's understating the Tesla case. But you see it from a lot of Wall
Streeters. This is how many vehicles they're going to produce. This is what
their margins are. I think that misses the Tesla story. That
misses where this is going. So the second way I'm going to talk
about it is the way I've been talking about it before. But i'm going to
extrapolate those numbers out to 2025 and 2030.
I'm going to give you some hard numbers. I did my own spreadsheet.
This is the Robotaxi model. This is how many Robotaxis Tesla will produce by year. How many Robotaxis they will own.
On the theory that Tesla will own its own Robotaxis. How much profit
they will make per Robotaxi. How much that adds up to, and what that means for market cap and share price. 
And the third approach is something novel that I'm just working
on now myself. I'm trying to work this through. It's dollars per kilowatt hour. This is the idea that Tesla is really at its core a battery company and that everything else springs off battery production. That Tesla is battery constrained so they are limited in how much money they
can make, and how much they can accelerate the
transition to sustainable energy. They are limited by battery production,
so battery production is the ultimate driver of Tesla's profits, and of our
society's move off of fossil fuels, onto more sustainable forms of energy. So I'm going to look at it in terms of
dollars per kilowatt hour. This goes toward my thesis that the long run Tesla Robotaxi will be smaller and will use smaller
battery packs. But i'm going to get into this again. First we're just going to talk about vehicle production and profit per vehicle
What I consider a more simplistic Wall Wtreet type analysis. And we're going to go to the Robotaxi
model and last we're going to talk about the battery model.
Release the Titan! So let's start with the standard Wall Street type analysis. Let's look at how many
vehicles Tesla is going to produce and how much money they'll make per
vehicle if they just sell the vehicles. And then what does that mean in terms of
profit per year, and what does that mean in terms of market cap and share price.
I'm going to start with the assumption - this is a big assumption, and it's an aggressive assumption - remember this is the bull case - that Tesla's growth will be 50 percent a year out into 2030. That Tesla will continue producing more and more vehicles.
""Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past. Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for
the next five to ten years? I think 50% is is the the likely number.
It's possible that is 40%. I would be very shocked if it's less than 40%. Even with force majeure, short of World War 3. This is an aggressive case and the
numbers I'm going to come up with are going to be even bigger than what where
you think I might be going. We're going to have to tamper that with
the reality that at some point there probably will be some limitation on
where we're going i'm going to start with the assumption
that 2021 involves 1 million vehicles produced
i think this is actually an understatement of how many vehicles the
tesla will produce i expect they will produce 500 000
vehicles out of fremont alone they will be in the ballpark of maybe
500 000 vehicles produced in shanghai berlin is going to produce a lot of
vehicles it may approach 500 000 but let's say 200
000 texas will produce vehicles i think we're going to see tesla produce
1.5 million vehicles in 2021 but i'm stating it as a million
and i understand that's aggressive because
a lot of projections are for 750 000 vehicles
in 2021. i don't think it matters a whole lot when you go down the road
but i want to give some sense of where i think this is going let's start with the
assumption that tesla produces a million vehicles
in 2021 that they make a profit of five thousand
dollars per vehicle maybe it's a thousand maybe it's six
thousand i'm just trying to work with a number here
i believe that they're getting margins up they're getting costs down
looking at the ballpark of a 20 margin on a 40 000
vehicle that's more than 5 000 profit for a vehicle so
let's go with 5 000. the thing that's really going to have a profound effect
on our financials is high volume and high margin that high margin part
comes from autonomy do people buy the the full self driving package or not
as we get close to full stop driving that's just gonna become more and more
compelling for a financial standpoint that's the real
mind-blowing situation is high volume high margin
because of autonomy at five thousand dollars profit per vehicle
and a million vehicles produced that's five billion dollars in profit
for market cap you would look at the price earnings ratio
you'd say okay they made five billion dollars
keep in mind i don't think in the short run tesla will actually earn five
billion dollars in profit i think tesla is suppressing their
profits in order to increase growth twenty percent margins
forty five thousand fifty thousand dollar vehicle be a ten thousand dollar
property per vehicle i don't think it's crazy to talk about
five thousand dollars for vehicle profit but the price earnings ratio is what
matters here when you're trying to determine market cap how much is the
company worth when you have a company that's
stable that's not growing particularly you might see a price earnings ratio of
10. when you have a company that's growing
well you're looking at a price earnings ratio of 20.
when you get to companies that are growing very fast you can see very high
price earnings ratios of 30 or more that is the price of the company over
the earnings the ratio there so i don't think 30 is an unreasonable
price earnings ratio for a fast growing company
so if we assume a price earnings ratio of 30 and 5 billion dollars of profit
we get to a market cap for a tesla of 150 billion dollars which is actually
less than the current market cap at that
valuation tesla is worth 750 a share in 2021.
now you could say wait a minute they're making more than five thousand dollars a
vehicle they're making ten thousand dollars a vehicle if you did that you'd
have 10 billion dollars in profit you'd have a 300 billion dollar market
cap which is about where we are now and a share price of around 1500 the
share price is assuming there are 200 million shares
i think there's 180 million right now but we're expecting some dilution some
additional shares to be created so i'm using 200 just as a
shorthand this is a simplified analysis going forward the key here is we're
looking at 50 growth year over year so in 2022 tesla
produces 1.5 million vehicles in 2023 it's 2.25 million vehicles
in 2025 that's five million vehicles produced if you're only making five
thousand dollars in profit per vehicle and you produce five million vehicles
you get 25 billion dollars in profit with a
price earnings ratio of 30 and 25 billion dollars of profit you're
looking at a 750 billion dollar market cap
approaching a trillion dollar market cap and the tesla share price
is around thirty eight hundred dollars a share in 2025.
if you say we're making 10 million dollars a vehicle that shoots up to a
1.5 trillion dollar market cap and 7 500 share price again this
is using what i consider to be the conservative wall street approach
to how tesla's profits you know pricing profits per vehicle translate to profits
overall market cap and share price you continue
on this path of 50 increase in vehicle production
you get to 7.5 million vehicles in 2026 you get to 11 million vehicles in 2027.
you get out to 2030 and it's 38 million vehicles produced and if
you're only making five thousand dollars a vehicle at 38
million vehicles you're talking about nearly 200 billion
dollars in profit for tesla at a price earning earnings
ratio of 30 that's a nearly six trillion
dollar market cap and a share price of 28 000
a share more than 28 000 a share if you assume that tesla's improved
their efficiencies and their they've managed to turn into
a ten thousand dollar profit per vehicle it's a market cap
of over 11 trillion and a share price of nearly sixty thousand dollars a share
these are really aggressive numbers i know but
i think they actually understate the tesla bull case of where this is going
i should talk for a second there are things that are going to limit
tesla's growth in theory competition will arise
i don't see it yet i see tesla being in the lead
volkswagen just said tesla is 10 years ahead
i think that other car companies are going to collapse
i think tesla is going to be one of the few remaining car companies
and the other car companies will be supplying the internal combustion engine
market which will be shrinking it is the electric vehicle market and
tesla is dominating it and no one is coming along so far who is close
to adopting tesla's model which is the machine that builds the machine no one
is talking about people are talking about making electric
vehicles tesla's talking about making the machine that builds the machine
i've given you the rough wall street style bull case
for where this would go tesla rapidly increases production
makes a certain reasonable profit per vehicle and they get to a share price of
somewhere between twenty five thousand and sixty thousand
dollars a share by twenty thirty that's a pretty good
bull case but it understates it so let's talk
about the robo-taxi model i made videos about this before
this is a somewhat radical theory elon has hinted that this is where we're
going a tesla will stop selling cars that
tesla will produce its own robo taxis it will keep them
itself and it will operate its own robo taxi network
with its own vehicles any locations where there's not enough supply for
sharing uh tesla will just make its own cars and
add them to the network in that place that is where i think this is going and
that is the model i'm about to go over with you
we'll go with the same assumptions about vehicle production
that vehicle production will increase at 50 percent a year
the battery model i'm going to talk about later is going to go with some
different assumptions but let's just go with this now
50 a year increase in production starting with a million vehicles
produced in 2021. i don't believe tesla is going
to stop selling cars in 2021. i think the stopping the sale of cars is
going to happen 2022 2023 somewhere like that the tesla
will begin rat once fsd goes live once the robo
taxi network goes live the price of a tesla vehicle goes to two
or three hundred thousand dollars a vehicle
and very few people will buy them tesla will keep them
yes we'll operate them as robo taxis this is the plan
i understand you may think it's crazy check out my earlier videos tesla will
stop selling cars i think it explains it i think it makes
perfect sense and elon has hinted at least that that's where
they're going same projections a million robo taxis
produced in 2021 2023 it's 2.25 million vehicles produced
2025 it's 5 million vehicles produced and 20 30 it's 38 million vehicles
produced now this assumption is off a little bit
that i'm going to make right now that tesla keeps every vehicle it
produces so instead of basing this on the vehicles
produced that year it's based on the accumulated production
and really to make this analysis fair and i didn't
do my numbers this way you would probably deduct all the vehicles from
2021 from this analysis and a lot of the vehicles from 2022 but
because the vehicle production is growing at 50
percent a year exponentially that's a small portion of the vehicles
and it's a trivial impact on the ultimate analysis let's go with
it it's an assumption it's a model i know it's not perfect
elon stated at autonomy day a projection that the robo taxi that each robo taxi
would produce thirty thousand dollars a day a year in
profit you say what would be the probable gross profit from a single robo
taxi we think probably something on the order
of 30 000 dollars per year and we're designing the cars for a
million mile life as well a nominal dollars that would be a little over 300
000 over the course of 11 years might be higher i think these
consumptions are actually relatively conservative
elon said at autonomy day that a typical robo taxi would produce 30 000
a year in profit some complicated analysis to that
uh it's not really that complicated i think it's actually going to be higher
than that at least at the beginning but i'm going with for this particular
approach right now a 30 000 year profit per vehicle so
assume tesla builds a million vehicles a million robo taxis
and operates them itself a million vehicles
making thirty thousand dollars in profit a year that's 30
billion dollars a year in profit from operating the robo taxi network with one
million vehicles at a market cap based on a price
earnings ratio of 30 that is a 900 million dollar
market cap it is a 900 billion dollar market cap
is a tesla share price of 4 500 a share i want to stress again this is
accelerating the transition to sustainable energy these million
vehicles are taking five million or more internal combustion
engine vehicles off the road eliminating that pollution it is
shifting millions of tr of trips from
gasoline-powered or diesel-powered trips to electric-powered trips that is making
our world a better place whether you believe in climate or change or not
reducing pollution there's all kinds of other pollution coming out of those
tailpipes this is a great thing but that's only
the beginning you go to 2022 it's a million and a half
vehicles produced but you add that to the first million
vehicles so now you have two and a half million robo taxis running
making thirty thousand dollars a year in profit 75 billion dollars in profit for
tesla price earnings ratio of 30. it's a 2.25
trillion dollar market cap and 11 000 share price
and we're only in 2022. i'm not talking about tesla energy
i'm not talking about the money tesla might make from selling
video game services or other services inside the car
there's a lot of theories about how else tesla might make money
from its robo-taxi network from its vehicles that have this software enabled
i'm not talking about any of that because i think that type of income is
trivial compared to the robo taxi network the
tesla team elon and zach said that in the conference
called yes there's other software revenue potential
but the robo taxi revenue potential outstrips everything
and right now by far by far fsd is just overwhelmingly the most important
thing everything else is pretty small by comparison
now when things do become full self-driving so what are people going to
do in the car well i guess we're probably going to do
productivity and entertainment of some kind
you know watch movies play games and do work
yeah fsd remains by far and away the biggest opportunity in the near term
but we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas
when the time is right so premium connectivity subscription is something
that we put in place and the ability to upgrade your vehicle
through the app for example on acceleration boost
or upgrading a standard range model 3 to a standard plus
adding rear heated seats so these are things that
we have and we're continuing to get feedback from the field and other things
that we can launch and we'll trickle those in with time
yeah but they're all very tiny compared with like
the like the step change to full self driving depending upon
how you calculate it is probably worth not you know at least a hundred thousand
dollars per car so that's a lot of software you have to
sell yeah tesla energy could be a lot of revenue and i didn't
factor that in if you follow some people's
views that's going to be big too so i'm being conservative by leaving out the
money from tesla energy let's take this out to 2025. tesla
produces five million vehicles in 2025. you add
that to all the robo taxis that were produced in the
four preceding years and you get to 13 million
tesla robo taxis operating on the roads if each tesla robo taxi is making 30 000
a year in profit now you're talking about
395 billion dollars in profit for that year from operating the robo
taxi network alone nearly 400 billion dollars in profit
at a price earnings ratio of 30 that is 12 trillion dollar market cap
that is a 60 000 share price 12 trillion dollar market cap
60 000 share price i want to get into that limiting factor thing again
at some point i believe that tesla will have to lower the price
of rides in its robo-taxi network but i think that's a long ways away
currently it costs in the ballpark of two to three dollars a mile
to use an uber these numbers are predicated on tesla charging only
a dollar a mile for the rides which is a big big drop
from what uber and lyft are charging and i believe there's a lot of people
who are going to be thrilled to not have to own a car and be able to ride around
at a dollar a mile it's going to save 20 of the population of the first world
of the united states and europe and japan and australia
even places like south korea it's going to save a lot of people so much money
that they're going to be happy to jump into a robo taxi and not have to
worry about taking care of a car i don't think this level of robo taxis 13
million robo taxis which replaces about 65 million uh
internal combustion engine cars or maybe 100 million that's not enough
to hit the point where prices are going to
fall but i do think they will fall eventually so that's another thing
that's going to limit the numbers we're going to head to
but let's skip forward 2027 tesla produces 12 11 million vehicles there's
a total of 32 million robo taxis in their stable by 2030
tesla producing 38 million robo taxis tesla would have
over a hundred million robo taxis operating on the roads
assuming they make thirty thousand dollars in profit a year i'm going to
give you more conservative numbers in a minute
but assuming they make 30 000 a year in profit
per vehicle or robo taxi that's 3.4 trillion dollars in profit in 2030
that is a market cap of 100 trillion dollars and a share price
of 500 000 going to that limiting factor we were talking about
let's change the assumptions let's say tesla only makes 20 000 a vehicle twenty
thousand dollars prices have come down and tesla only
makes twenty thousand dollars a year in profit
on its robo taxi network if you drop it to twenty thousand dollars a year
then profit in 2025 is only 200 only 263 billion dollars
the market cap is only 8 trillion and the share price is only 40 000
only in 2030 it's a 2.2 trillion dollar annual profit
a 68 trillion dollar market cap and a share price of 340 thousand dollars
if you go further and you say you know what there's gonna be so much
competition there's gonna be so much pressure on tesla's pricing for its robo
taxi network they're only going to make ten thousand
dollars a vehicle in 2030. okay that's only an annual profit of 1.1
trillion dollars it's only a market cap of 34 trillion
dollars and it's only a share price of a hundred and seventy thousand dollars
if you buy into the robo taxi model then a 170 000 share price
in 2030 is a conservative estimate you're looking at a share price in 2025
of 20 000 that's assuming a lot of the
limiting factors come into play and reduce tesla's profits
and ultimately reduce market cap and share price and that's not even getting
into the battery model that i'm going to talk
about next hang on hold on to your seats it's coming it's not going to be that
much bigger than the robo taxi model i described but it is going to be bigger
so the third model is something completely different
this is something that i've been stewing on for a while
i talked about it in a recent interview i think the way we're thinking about
tesla misses where the company is really going it's not a car
company it's not a robo taxi company either
although that's the model i just used which i found really compelling
but another way of looking at tesla is as a battery
company the really big change the software for self-driving is a huge
change that's a monstrous change but tesla is producing a ridiculous
increase in battery availability and there's the
battery productions going through the roof
the number of lithium ion batteries the kilowatt hours or megawatt hours or
gigawatt hours of battery production in the world was
much smaller and tesla is going to accelerate it
extremely rapidly and elon has repeatedly mentioned and
not just elon the tesla team repeatedly talks about
batteries as the constraint on the things that tesla wants to do
to grow revenue to grow profit and to accelerate the transition to sustainable
energy does this shift from smaller pack
vehicles suggest that tesla is not battery constrained as in the past
well i'd just like to reinforce emphasize
you know any mining companies out there please mine more nickel
okay wherever you are in the world please mine more nickel
tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time
hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies please get nickel
so instead of thinking about tesla as a car
company instead of thinking about tesla as a software company or a robo taxi
company let's think about tesla as a battery
company that tesla is going to be producing
gigawatt hours of batteries and that amount of gigawatt hours
produced is going to grow and let's go with that 50 a year
increase in production now i'm going to make an assumption
again so the question is how does tesla maximize instead of
thinking about maximizing profit for a vehicle
instead of thinking about making profits in a dollars per mile
what if we thought about it in terms of dollars per kilowatt hour
or dollars per megawatt hour of battery production
and then the question is how does tesla optimally distribute batteries
to the various applications it's developing to maximize profit and to
maximize the acceleration of our transition to sustainable energy
as i've said before multiple times i do not believe that the long term
robo taxi will be as big as a model 3 or model y
i believe that ultimately the ultimate robocar the ultimate robo taxi
will be a single passenger podcar robo taxi
why because it will be able to take someone
from point a to point b using the smallest battery pack
and if you have a i'm going to use 20 right now the typical tesla has let's
say a 60 kilowatt hour battery pack if instead you develop vehicles that use
20 kilowatt hour packs and you produce three times as many
vehicles you take three times as many people from
destination a to destination b and you displace three times as many
internal combustion engine vehicles you reduce pollution three times as much
if you're able to accomplish the same mission with a smaller battery pack
and this creates an interesting challenge which i'm not going to address
in that video i think that's going to be for a future video is
i know a lot of people are big on tesla energy and i think tesla energy is an
important step to the future but is the dollars per kilowatt hour
produced by tesla energy by grid storage as much as the dollars per kilowatt hour
produced by transportation and not just dollars per kilowatt hour
is the reduction in use of fossil fuels greater
i believe that robo taxis are such a revolutionary change in our society
absolutely insane how big this is going to be
that that is going to accelerate our transition to sustainable energy
even more radically more than tesla energy
i think tesla energy is great i think they should continue building it
but i think it's insane to devote large numbers of batteries to tesla
energy when those same batteries accomplish
more in robo taxis so let's get to some numbers suppose
and i'm making up this number i don't know what the number is i don't know if
it's 50 gigawatt hours or 100 gigawatt hours but let's say in 2021
tesla produces 50 gigawatt hours of batteries
keep in mind i'm talking about tesla producing batteries tesla is also buying
batteries from others particularly catl and i think at least
one or two other companies i'm using 50 because it
made the numbers work i think it actually might be 100
gigawatt hours in 2021 or more but let's start with 50 those are
conservative numbers those reduce that reduces the profit numbers that i'm
going to come up with so if tesla produces 50 gigawatt hours
of batteries in 2021 and its battery production increases 50
percent a year and by 2030 tesla will be at the magic
two terawatt hours of batteries produced that's the number
that elon has talked about um in 2025 tesla will be producing 250
gigawatt hours of batteries and i think we may see a step
change i think whatever tesla's doing in their skunk works
uh whatever's happening in fremont there's some new battery cell lines
being uh developed there may be a big step
change and we might see a much larger number of batteries produced soon
but let's go with these numbers because they're conservative
so the question is if tesla's average vehicle
has a 50 kilowatt hour pack and you produce 50 gigawatt hours of batteries
that means you're able to produce 1 million vehicles million vehicles and
we're going to use my wall street numbers if you produce a
million vehicles and you make thirty thousand dollars a
vehicle then you end up with profit of 30
billion dollars in 2021 you end up with a market cap of 900 billion dollars and
tesla share price is 4 500 that's one way of looking at it if you
follow this approach with profit of 30 000
a vehicle 50 kilowatt hour packs you end up in 2025
with 5 million vehicles produced and a 60 000 share price at a 12 trillion
dollar market cap and in 2030 you've produced two terawatt
hours of batteries 38 million vehicles using those two
terawatt hours of batteries 3.4 trillion dollars in profit
and a share price of 500 000 if you follow what i'm saying and you say you
know what we can accelerate the transition to
sustainable energy by going to 25 kilowatt hour packs
or produce twice as many vehicles we're pretty work battery constrained
but we go to 25 kilowatt hour packs and we go with vehicles that are hyper
efficient smaller vehicles that weigh less that
enable you get 200 plus miles of range out of a 25 kilowatt hour pack
then in 2021 you produce two million vehicles instead of one million vehicles
i don't think we're going to make the transition to this 25 kilowatt hour pack
approach yet i think that's going to come in a few
years but for the simplicity of the model that's the way i'm approaching it
two million vehicles make 40 billion dollars in profit at 20 000. now
you've reduced your profit to 20 000 a vehicle is the approach i'm taking
when you go to smaller packs you're making less profit for vehicle i
think it's right maybe you make more profit for a vehicle
but let's just go with this so you get 40 billion dollars in profit
that year you have a market cap of 1.2 trillion and tesla is already worth six
thousand dollars a share the next year you've produced three
million vehicles your total vehicles is now
five million vehicles because you're adding the two million from the previous
year to the three million and you're making twenty thousand
dollars per robo taxi you make a hundred billion dollars in profit
in 2022 market caps three trillion share price is already 15
000. stretch that out the 2025. in 2025 tesla produces 10 million
vehicles with 25 kilowatt hour packs the total number of vehicles is now 26
million robo taxis operating they're making a profit of 500 billion
dollars a year market cap is now 15 almost 16 trillion
dollars and the share price is approaching 80
000 a share stretch it out to 2030. in 2030 tesla produces 77 million
vehicles this is where you start to reach that limit of is there a market
for that many vehicles and they have a total of 226 million
robo taxis operating that would get you to 4.5 trillion in
profit 136 trillion dollar market cap and a share price of 680
000 now i'm not saying that's reasonable i'm just saying that's a way of looking
at it keep in mind by doing what we're doing here tesla is lowering the cost in
order to get that profit down to twenty thousand dollars a vehicle
the price per mile is dropped you're not getting a dollar a mile anymore you're
getting maybe 60 cents a mile but your cost per mile on the vehicle is
down to 10 cents a mile or less so you're still potentially making
substantial profits on that vehicle let's take it a step further let's say
tesla goes hyper efficient and they go with my podcar
and i'm not going to go with a 10 kilowatt hour pack let's say they go
with a 15 kilowatt hour pack i think ultimately we may see podcar
robo taxis with 10 kilowatt hour packs you can make five times as many vehicles
but let's go with 15 kilowatt hours and you're dividing that 50 gigawatt
hours in the first year by 15 kilowatt hours you get 3.3 million vehicles
produced get a profit of 50 billion dollars in
that first year 2021 market caps 1.5 trillion and tesla's
worth 7 500 a share stretch that out to 2025.
tesla produces nearly 17 million vehicles we're talking about podcar robo
taxis i know this is an oversimplified model but
tesla produces 17 million vehicles and has 44 million
robo taxis in the network on the road serving people
you drop the profit to fifteen thousand dollars a robo taxi
per year you could go down to ten kilowatt hour packs and ten thousand
dollars profit you can play games with this all you want but i'm just
doing some kind of modeling here you get 659
billion dollars in profit get a market cap of 20 trillion dollars
and you get a share price of 99 000 that's in 2025. stretch this out 2030.
tesla produces 128 million single passenger podcar robo taxis with 15
kilowatt hour packs makes a profit of nearly 6 trillion
dollars market cap is now 170 trillion dollars
and you've got a share price of 850 000 a share
that's the model models aren't perfect you're always going to see
quirks with models and things that don't make sense with models and i think it's
seems unlikely we're going to see a market cap of 170 trillion dollars or
six trillion dollars in profit there will be things that limit this
but gotta look at the other side of this if tesla is able to
let's say tesla does shift this podcar robo-taxi model
and they're able to get the cost per mile down below a dollar a mile
down below 50 cents a mile let's say they get the cost down to 25 cents a
mile if tesla is able to get the cost down to
25 cents a mile more people will take more trips
because you've cut the cost of travel in the united states and i think in western
europe the average person pays about 60 cents a mile
for owning their own car and driving it around
and they drive less because of that cost per mile that it costs them
if you are able to get the cost of transportation down to 25 cents a mile
if you are able to make transportation more convenient
because the robo-taxi model is more convenient you never have to take your
car for an oil change you never have to fill the tank
you never have to replace tires you don't have to worry about windshield
wipers the robo taxi business takes care of all
of that at a lower cost per mile than you would spend if you did it yourself
and this radically expands the freedom people have to travel
you put screens in there and let people play video games while they're traveling
you connect them to the internet with a star link or however you you do it or a
5g connection this could be the most radical change in
society and i'm predicting this in 2030 our world will be so different
we can't even it's going to change more in the next 10 years
and it changed in the last hundred it's going to be mind-boggling
how our world is going to be we're going to have people on mars we're going to
all be riding around a single passenger podca robo taxis we're going to have
neuro links in our brains we're going to be riding around in
tunnels going 150 miles around town at 600 miles an hour
and these tunnels going from city to city the airline industry's dead the car
industry's dead commuter rail is dead all these
industries are shot tesla has taken over the world and made
the world a better place for all of us everyone tesla minibus i didn't even get
into how a tesla minibus is going to use a reasonable size
battery pack to carry 10 people and that cost per mile is going to be
even lower that's going to get the cost per mile down to a nickel a mile or less
so poor people in india poor people in africa poor people in other countries
poor people and homeless people in america
a lot of people who currently are mobility constricted
will have much greater mobility it is going to make our lives so much better
the biggest limiting factor the biggest thing that it can impair tesla's share
price and at the same time impair the
transition to sustainable energy and at the same time clean the air
so that people in china can breathe all of these massive changes the biggest
threat is government if you believe that big government is
going to make the world better then why didn't they do this already
it is capitalism it is to innovation that comes from
freedom that is making this innovation we are seeing in front of our eyes
possible and if you let government get in the way
they will jump at the opportunity to seize the profits to seize control
and to impair to protect old industries that pollute
that is what politicians do and we need you
the people to say no we want tesla to flourish
we want tesla to grow because it's making our world a better place
this is about making the world a better place and if you take away the incentive
for investors to invest in companies that make the world a
better place there will be fewer companies making the world a better
place getting back to the point here i've laid
out for you multiple ways three different models of
how tesla's share price is going to grow how tesla's going to grow and how it's
going to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy
i'm tired of people saying well i don't want my people riding in my car i'm
going to keep it in the garage well you're not accelerating the transition
to sustainable energy if you buy an electric vehicle and you
keep it in the garage you're accelerating the transition to
sustainable energy if you send the vehicle out there
and it operates 10 times as much as it would have if it was just you
if you use your vehicle to serve others you will make money
and you will make the world a better place robo taxi model is the future
you're probably not going to bother buying one you're probably going to be
happy to ride around there's certain businesses
like contractors who need their tools with them i haven't figured out how that
model works are they just driving beat up old
uh internal you know gasoline and diesel trucks
are they gonna get cyber trucks i don't know cyber trucks are gonna be so
valuable it's hard to imagine the typical contractor using them
that's an interesting problem i don't have an answer to it
it may be that you have a tray with all your tools on it and when the cyber
truck comes and picks you up it has a winch and it pulls the tools up into the
bed and you rent the cyber truck for your
trip over and you call it again when you're going to go back
i'm not sure how that's going to play out on the plain and simple robo-taxi
model and i think this is a really interesting question
if you think about tesla as a battery company and you maximize
profit per kilowatt hour and using that as a proxy for maximizing
our reduction in fossil fuel consumption and our reduction in the pollution of
fossil fuels this is a really innovative way of looking at it i'm going to do
another video on that down the road i'd love to see your responses please
comment tell me why you think i'm wrong tell me
how much you think i'm wrong i am projecting a tesla share price in
20 30 of a hundred thousand dollars a share
and that's conservative compared to the numbers in my models
it's extremely conservative compared to the numbers in my models
and i believe the numbers in my models are probably wrong for some reason but i
haven't figured it out yet so tell me you want to talk about rattle
radical change check out neuralink this is amazing people love this video

70,Cb-qHrVPIhc, hi chicken gang and friends this year i call the 600 price target we are here michael who has been here since i was a small channel i had a deal with him when tesla hits three thousand dollars dinner yum yum many said i was nuts but yeah i'm a little nuts so in 2021 i predict tesla is gonna be 800 well 2020 is one of the most crazy years in investing it has ever been i'm glad no i'm seriously glad my experience and knowledge put me in a place where i can change many of your lives and i'm really grateful for this 2020 i mean if you could see the future knowing the entire economy is coming to a standstill place shut down the amount of life loss and jobs loss you will have taken all your money out of the stock market and sit on the cash and miss all that upside in investing is always very dynamic and no matter the amount of theories that you learn nothing beats experience investing is something that we will do over a lifetime so do not rush don't formal position yourself for all the ups and downs and i assure you is going to be very rewarding in 2020 we experienced tesla stop plunging 63 in march to the normal investor they would have chickened out and sold we took the opportunity to load up as much as we could 2020 was really crazy elon's tweeted wiping away 14 billion but at the same time showing his leadership qualities by defying the authorities and only asked for himself to be arrested we saw the stupidity of the world expecting stock price to search after battery day instead the world was like what just happened it was the s p 500 inclusion that shot the stock up words 2020 is the year we see the power of disruptive technologies one of the key characteristics as mentioned by cathy wood all the time innovation gains traction in times of crisis we've seen tesla gain market share the only automaker to gain market share while everybody else is [ __ ] 2020 is almost over it's december christmas is just around the corner so give yourself a pat on the back you did well considering all the [ __ ] that just happened cheers before i move on to 2021 i'd like to thank you all for the likes that you contributed i received like a hundred thousand likes since the initiative and i will double the contribution for start keep all the likes coming you and i know when we donate we are not sure how our money is being used and that's why i prefer to donate to places where i can see like the actual person doing the work because it comes from the heart donating to dean snyder he is doing great work and showing the world how wonderful animals are so anyway grateful for all your likes these are the six things to look forward to in 2021 at least in my opinion the important events to watch out for to bring tesla to 800 number one tesla will announce between third to fifth january 2021 reaching its goal of 500 000 cars delivered despite the seven week pandemic related shutdown at the same time i expect tesla to give new guidance for 2021 delivery targets i expect a target close to 900 000 cars think about it it's almost double its crazy growth number two ramping up of tesla insurance in 2021 in the u.s germany uk and china tasmanian covered this tesla hiring program managers for insurance products in these nations elon musk explained during the q2 2020 conference call they wanted to get the insurance right before wrap does the delay and so really ultimately where we want to get to with tesla insurance is to be able to use the data that's captured in the car in the driving profile of the person in the car to be able to assess correlations and probabilities of crash and and be able then to assess a premium on a monthly basis for that customer in essence the best possible slash fairest motor insurance product ever created because tesla collects data from its car which no insurance companies can ever do tesla's product is going to massively undercut insurance companies while bringing massive consistent revenue streams coming in number three tesla to unview the 25 000 car design in china china has already started hiring my best guess the 25 000 design in china will be reviewed somewhere in march 2021. this event in my opinion will be the most significant event setting up the base price of a quality electric vehicle i said quality because currently there are cheaper ones but they are flying coffin the 25 000 eb will be using the new four six eight zero cells i estimate the range of 300 miles is going to blow the mind of every donkey including me for the fourth giga berlin will start low volume production in the first half of the year followed by high volume production three to five months down the road we've seen this in china so giga berlin will produce the model y using the four six eight zero cells the most advanced paint shop and the cell to chase's design elon did mention germany is going to take big risks by being the first in all these i mean when did he ever not take big risks in my opinion the biggest risk for 2021 is the ramping of 4680 sales number five around the same time giga texas will have finished construction and started low volume production of the cyber truck tesla has more cyber truck pre-orders than the number of cars he has delivered in the last two years 650 000 pre-orders if the cyber truck was available in my country i would have just pre-ordered that just imagine a cyber truck in your rearview mirror number six i'm really like skeptical on this but elon says he is confident i'm extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the tesla customer base next year well he may miss timelines and recent months ahead of schedule but he eventually gets the job done my timeline for full self-driving level five was three years and in the most bullish case and seven to ten years with the bearish case he said next year is solving full self driving is solving the march of nines it has to be 99.9999999 right all the time what do you guys think do let me know in the comments if it's possible i read them if it's true that's it man full self driving is the thing that will bring tesla's evaluation exceeding 4 trillion and that's me just being conservative wrapping up if tesla executes on everything above a 800 price target is pretty conservative i believe there's so much more room to grow and the thing is you will keep hearing [ __ ] from skeptics i heard this all my life in my years of investing every other month there will be a stock market crash article tesla every other week will have one extra donkey that pops up shorting the position it's really up to you to really understand your investment thesis and to see the long term proposition appreciate the thumbs up i hope you enjoy the video and invest safe,TSLA,"['hi',

71,dbJSdO5p7Yk," Good morning it's Clay @claytrader.com. This will be a live trade video
where I try to capture some of my trades as they play out live. Market opens up here in
less than two minutes. Very quickly, for those of you that are maybe new to my
videos when I say live, what I mean is that
this is not a situation where everything has already been recorded and now I'm coming back
and doing a trade recap or some sort of post commentary,
or, you know, voiceover, nothing like that. This is all myself seeing the information
for the very first time. So if you want raw thoughts,
raw reactions, raw emotions, you will find that here, but
to be respectful of your time, if you are seeking some sort
of video, that's nicely edited, nicely scripted. You
will not get that here, but if you just want a
raw nitty gritty look into what it's like to be a day trader and how a day trading can play out then you'll find that with this video. So market opens up here and now then basically less than a minute. So I'll go ahead and pause and I'll see you back at the open. All right. I'm watching Tesla
here out of the opening gates, which just opened up Tesla. Very-- Not the Tesla I'm used to, but we'll give it a little bit. So I do like six 72, especially if this thing
can bounce up a little bit, which it's doing right now. I don't want to take it on
this opening candle though. Yeah. Six 72 now. I do like it as potential. Actually you know what? I want to see this
candle stay above it too, Just because volume does kind of seem sketchy on it right now. So I'm gonna look for a
little bit more confirmation That may cause me to get left behind. That is a very real possibility. I may get left behind on the
trade by just not being willing to take it on this candle here. Come on, stay above six 72. Come on, stay above it. Oh no. Oh, Aw. Just dropped below it. That is disappointing. All right, well I will go
ahead and pause for now and I'll look around for-- Well, actually, what's
going on with F-R-E-Q? Well, this one is such a big
gap down it's hard to see Let me move that over. Okay, not a whole lot. DLPN. Very fast mover Tesla. I like, I like that right there at six-- What is that? Yeah. Six 70 50 could work
out for our scalp though, but I don't know. I keep talking about this volume. This volume has me a little worried, but I mean that is a nice setup
right now that's formed. Why don't I do this? Go to six
70 with just 50 shares then so I can control my risk that way. So in at six 70,50 Looking for this thing to
get down to at least lows at six 69 and below, I
should say the lowest from previous day, that is. Well, I'm bouncing up now. Just give it a little chance here. Yeah, this thing really
is all over the place. I'm glad I just went with 50 shares. If it comes down to six 69 though, I will look to add in some more shares, but as of right now, we'll see what it wants to do. So yeah, if it comes back
down to six six nine, I will add in 50 more shares. So that would be adding to a winner. Yeah, six 69,50-ish. We'll call it if it can
break down through there. But yeah, Tesla not totally behaving. Whoa. Oh, wow. Okay, well nevermind on that. That happened very, very fast. I would like to see six-68 here Good. Wow. That happened and (gasps) snap back quick. I have my order down there at six 68 to pull some off the table. All right I took some off
at six 69,30 just because technically speaking, I,
you know, made the comment about how I wanted to
see this down below lows and I got it below lows,
but then all of a sudden I wasn't taking any profit off the table. So I got a little greedy and
maybe that greed is gonna catch up to me here. Although at least I acknowledged it to look on the bright side of things and pulled some off the table. Goodness, thank you. All right. Well, $33 trade there. And my gut instincts were,
were basically right that, I mean, it was a winning
trade, but very choppy and I did get a move, but I mean, you saw how fast that move all of a sudden just turned around so I'm going to keep an eye on it. We'll see if it wants to maybe go a little bit smoother, if you will but let's see what else is out there. I'm gonna go ahead and
pause for now. Okay. Looking to short this at
a break of, there we go in at six 60, six 69. I would like to see some
downwards fall through now. Again, just 50 shares. Okay, out there. Oh, wait. That was only
a 25 share. Whoops. Right out there now I'm
down a hundred dollars. Yeah. I just don't feel comfortable with-- I feel like this thing could
all of a sudden snap back upwards and get a lot worse. Like I said, I was looking
for that breakdown. I actually waited for the breakdown, which is why I chased it
a bit to the downside. And then there, as you see there was just absolutely no breakdown. So, All right, now I am down a hundred dollars so, all right. Not the cleanest of starts, but, and now it comes right back down. See now it's just toying with me And there's what I was
originally looking for. (laughs) Well, that's how it
goes sometimes. That is just how it goes. Okay, well I'll make this alerted. All right. I will go
ahead and pause, but yes, now I'm down a hundred dollars. I am watching Tesla again
for a potential short here at six 67. This thing has continued
to just go sideways. So it's a question of is this finally gonna be a, you know, a last gas where it just gives up
and goes to the downside or is this some sort of
bottom that's truly forming, But I'm not convinced
enough right now at six 68. I'm convinced that a
little bit more at six 67, which is why I'm waiting for that. So in there at six-67, Is this actually it, or did
I just get suckered in again? Let's see. There we go. There we go. Can we get down through six
65, at least give me that Can this thing break down? Well, little bit of a bounce here, but (laughs) Gonna give this
thing some wiggle room, but as you can see, gave it chance, gave it a chance. And in doing so now,
potentially, you know, pulling a winning trade off the table to have a losing trade. But like I said, I wanted to see that
thing down below six 65 in order for this to, you know, trade that made sense in
the first place to take. what is that? Whoaa, six 68. So if it goes up here and hits six 60 or six 70 comes down to six 68, I will add. So let's see what it wants to do. Now I need to-- No, I'm-- I'm watching the five minute
disregard the adding at six 68. That's too risky. Six 67 makes more sense to me to add But I just really don't like
these where I'm sitting here waiting, waiting, waiting. So it's down below six 67 again. And then that fast back up. And all this with 50 shares. So from an opportunity
cost perspective of time, I mean, is this really worth my time to be sitting here waiting to
see if I get the breakdown? Maybe if this thing really
moves like I know Tesla can, but Come on Tesla, just get
down through six-65. I know you want to. All right. I'm all out there for a modest, modest win. Goes back to
that time opportunity cost. And if this thing were to
bounce and then I take out and you know, we lose the trade. So it has been a sloppy, sloppy morning. The only thing I've done right
is acknowledge that Tesla, which I love to trade, is
not quite its normal self. Very choppy. And the one thing I've done right is I've lowered position size. So
even with all the choppiness, even with all kind of the,
the sloppiness of things, I'm only down $72, which for
me, that's a manageable hole. That's something that's not
going to take, you know, a whole lot to be climbed out of. So I'm happy with that. But yeah. I think I just need to
move on from Tesla for now. The five minute's looking
very interesting though. As in is there gonna be some
sort of upwards bounce there? So I'm gonna keep an
eye on six 70 actually as potential long, but as of now, yeah, I've given this thing plenty
of times to break down and it just doesn't want to do it. So from a time perspective,
I'm gonna go ahead and see what else is out there. So I'll go ahead and pause. So here's the current trade plan right now that I just gave to my community. I want to see TSLA hit
six 70, get rejected, for short at six 68 and then a stop over-- Whoops. Stop over 670. There we go. So let's see if this
wants to happen or not. But like I said, step one,
gotta get up to six 70. Now we can go slightly
above 670, that's fine too. But that's the current game plan. So we'll see if the price can actually get up to that 670 mark or not. And if it does I'll get
the video rolling again. And that way we can see
how things play out. All right, mission complete. I'm actually going to go to six 69 here, get a little bit more aggressive. So if the price does come down
to six 69, I'm getting short. But to be fair, maybe this
is some sort of breakout. That could very well be the case. In at six 69. Let's see if we can get more
of a push to the downside here. Like I said, I did take on more risk by not waiting for six 68. So I'm in at 669,12. See what it wants to do.. Okay there we go. I want to see this thing really get moved in the downside It's I think it's gotta be
able to get to at least six 67. There we go. Oh come on, it didn't
feel me at six 67 though. Huh, just so tricky. Wanted some out at six 67,
So now my scale out point had to be at six 68. I think can it actually
now get down below six 67, is the question. Yeah, I think so. Can it get down below six? Yeah. Six 67, that was that
point from earlier, wasn't it. I was like, why does
that sound so familiar? Yeah, that is a key area That's just been very, very stubborn. Let's see if it wants to come back down. I'm wondering if I should add back in. I need to just play it
as I am. This is Tesla, as you can see, I don't have a, I have a read on it and I mean, I'm making money on this trade, but I don't have necessarily as good of a read as what I would like Come on, just get down
through six six six. Can this thing finally go? I mean, for members they were up $2 on that alert that you saw. I mean, they could have scaled up for at least a little bit more, but I mean, at least $2. All right. (laughs) Oh man. Just-- Tesla does not want to play ball. This area down here is-- I mean,
it's worth watching though. Cause once again,
stubborn, stubborn level. And let me just show you
what this all looks like on the five minutes,
look at the five minute. That pink line there is that
200 period moving average. So it's just a situation where it keeps going down there. It's just a question of
is the price ever gonna actually get the break from it? Because it keeps fake breaking. It keeps breaking blow
the pink line, back up, fake, below it. So that's why I keep pulling
because I'm thinking, okay, is this finally the break of
that 200 period moving average? And it keeps, no, it keeps fake breaking to the downside and
it's driving me insane. But again, to my credit, at least I acknowledged that
Tesla's being goofy today, which is why I've scaled
down the position size. So with all the goofiness
only down $10 now at this one. Okay. So again, almost same thing, six 67. 150, yeah that's fine. I'll take this short. If six 67 wants to come back into play. I will take that once again short. But again, it's got to
actually come back into play. As of right now, not looking
like that's gonna happen because this thing continues on up. So once more, another fake breakdown. To be fair though, I mean that alert that you saw me give, members still had the
opportunity to make $2 per share in a very small amount of time. So it's not like it was a
losing trade in the sense of, Oh man, everybody just
flat out lost money. People got in and then the stock just went
the opposite direction. No people got, people
could have gotten in. People could have gotten in, you know, if they played it like
me, up at six 69 and it still did move $3 per
share from the six 69 or $2 per share from six 68.
But the point here being is, there's just not any follow through. There's not any actual
breakdown of that area, which is what's getting frustrating 'cause it's looking like
it's gonna break down. It's looking like the
bears are gonna take over and then no. So, You know, in a, in a weird type of way, I'm kind of glad this is all happening from an education standpoint, just to give you a reality check
of kind of how trading works, because I realized
sometimes I'll post videos I'll get in and it'll be Tesla and Tesla will move right in my favor and within, you know, 20 seconds I'm up, just crazy numbers. But in this situation, it's just not, it's moving, but not really with any sort of follow through, but all right, well, let's
see what else I can find. Okay. Watching six 72 50 here for a short on you best Tesla, six 72, six 75. If it wants to come back into play here. In that six 73, 12. Let's see what it wants to do here. It goes up over six 76 I gotta be out. And then that'll be for me on the day. Potentially, probably I don't know. I don't know if this was
a forced trade or not, because at that moment where I got in, It was looking good, watching six 76. All right, Down 160 on
the day, I gotta be done. It's just not working out. It was not my day. It is what it is. It happens. But yes, there, I'm just going to move on. So a little over 30 minutes
in, down 160-ish dollars and I'll just have to
live to fight another day. But within the grand scheme of things, this was merely a flesh
wound, not a big deal at all. And I don't say that because
I don't want to come across like, Oh yeah, money just grows on trees. And I don't mean it in
that sense. I just mean it in the sense of, from a
money management standpoint, from a viewpoint of, you know, will I be okay? Is my you account, okay still? Do I think I can get this money back from a trading standpoint? Yes. From all those angles,
everything is perfectly fine, but, but it is what it is. Now, If you do enjoy these live
trade videos before I go a couple of quick requests on my part. First off, hit the like button and leave a quick
comment, even it it's just a thumbs up emoji, because these aren't the easiest videos to make. They are live So I have to think for myself, I have to talk to you, I
have to execute my trades. I have to think for the chat room in terms of what alerts I wanna make, I have to type up those alerts.
So there's a lot going on. So these videos not impossible or anything like that, but they do take a fair amount of effort and I'm willing to continue to do them. And I will keep doing them as long as I know that there's interest. And you know, like I said, the very quick, easy way to communicate to me that you do enjoy these, and you want for me to continue to make these,
just hit that like button and then leave a quick comment down below. And you know, that goes a long way in telling me that my
time is being spent wisely doing these videos. So thanks for helping me,
or thanks for helping me out in the sense of giving me feedback on whether or not these videos are good. Like I said, hit the like button or leave a quick comment below And it is what it is, So hopefully you had a better day than this, but sometimes these days will happen. Everybody take care. First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video. Real quick, before you go I wanna invite you to a
live webinar, web class training, workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it. But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself
from being an employee, to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing
day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover three
keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency
within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way. The second key is super awesome because it quite literally, is wired
into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to
use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders. I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the
pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way too good to
be true, but it's not. And I'll show you how it all works. Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer
session that is, again, totally live. Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up
as it will be recorded. And you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you. Click the image on the screen or click the link down in
the description box. So you can get the date and
time and claim your spot, which I should note is
limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
If you have any questions, let me know. If not,
I'll be seeing you soon.",TSLA,"['Good', 'morning', 'it', 's', 'Clay', 'claytrader', 'com', 'This', 'will', 'be', 'a', 'live', 'trade', 'video', 'where', 'I', 'try', 'to', 'capture', 'some', 'of',

72,zoA_sp_Ccpk," Hi traders! A short recap of my trading session 
today. Take a look at the S&P 500 - it's coming   down that's the key to everything. Now take 
a look at Tesla. Tesla is also coming down,   tried to move higher earlier but now it has a very 
nice bearflag formation right here at the lows.   One of the strongest technical formation is a bearflag
and I'm about to short it right as it moves to   a new low and here we go very close; clicking the 
button and I'm short now I'm gonna fast forward it   so you can see what happened but immediately 
you can see how the bearflag formation   draws in a lot of sellers look at the way 
it came down look at the extended volume a   little bit not much but it still is coming down 
the volume will grow. I'm already up 15,000 and I'm   looking for the first sign of a pullback which is 
right now I mean the first time you can see the   candle slightly moving higher this green candle 
you're seeing right now I just reached my one to   one risk/reward ratio, actually a little bit more 
than that and I'm still holding 400 shares hoping   that it's going to continue coming down so I get 
even a little bit better than that so although   my risk/reward is one to one I'm always trying 
to get a bit more. That's why I'm keeping the   400 shares; I'm trying to wait for a bigger move 
hoping for a bigger move but anyway the first   challenge was taking it under the lows and getting 
just a bit over my one-to-one risk/reward ratio   and at that point if you did like my Tesla 
trade before we move to the next trades I will   appreciate if you can give us a thumb up; helps our 
channel, helps more people like you watch trading   videos so thank you for that and let's continue 
to my new trades. And here's my BLUE trade. That   is in fact my second BLUE trade because my first 
BLUE trade was a losing trade. Now I did try   earlier and you can see the result here down six 
thousand seven hundred dollars I did move in right   over here and moved out once it moved over the 
highs that was the right thing to do but now I'm   preparing for my second trade as it comes under 
33.10 I think that would be the point of no return   and as you can see it's about to get there; getting 
ready to show six thousand shares. Shorting now.   Now, why do I believe so strongly that this stock 
should come down? Because it's a big gap and go now   here comes a very fast forward so you can see what 
happened next now when the stock is down 30% it's   not likely to succeed moving higher some people 
are buying it some people are catching falling   knife some people are doing the big mistake trying 
to see if it can actually move higher because it's   down so much or to average down the losses well 
that's not the right thing to do the right thing   to do is to look for a second opportunity because 
again it's all about timing. Gap and go usually   does make it so I look for the point of no return 
the point under 33.10 was that point, now it's down   more than one point as you can see here now 
about take my partial just moved under the lows   about to click the button eight thousand dollars, 
covered my loss and a little bit more than that   now and again the whole idea here is that when you 
have a big gap and go like 30% currently as you can   see 31% the fact that it moved up earlier 
just indicates one thing; I had the wrong timing.   It's likely to come down so I'm looking for the 
second time the second time where I can see that   there's a good opportunity where it looks to me 
like it's about to fail moving higher and probably   will give up to the gap and go strong downside 
momentum and it did happen so really trading   is not only about knowing how gap and go's work, 
it's about going for the right opportunity and the   right timing my first trade was wrong my second 
trade was right. Last trade we're going to discuss   today is Tesla again well I did mention it was my 
Tesla trade. Take a look at my first trade it was a   classic bearflag formation; the pole, the flag as 
it was going sideways and the breakdown underneath.   Now what you're seeing here is a continuation a 
trend it's out of the trend here and it's coming   down and I'm about to short it and I don't expect 
the first result like I did in the first trade   so I'm about to show shorting now 4000 shares. 
Now Tesla is approaching the lows and it looks   to me like it's about to challenge the lows 
and as you can see it's clearly trending lower   now it's moving up a bit but I'm not worried. 
Why I'm not worried? I'm not worried because   it is trending lower and the trend is your 
best friend. Now take a look at my stop-loss   it's right over there and take a look at my target 
which is right here below so I'm looking again for   approximately a one to one risk award ratio hoping 
that it's going to come down to my target but once   it does reach my target as you can see it's on the 
way I will not take my partial unless I can see   that it's pulling back up over so again I'm trying 
to get a little bit more than my normal one-to-one   risk/reward it was just very, very close right here 
and I missed it by a few cents but again as it is   touching my target I'm not taking my partial I'm 
waiting for a clear move under so I can probably   get a bit more and just did that so again 
following it hoping it's going to continue it   it does come to the point where it's reaching 
my target and much more than that and that's the   point where I'm thinking about taking my partial 
you can see it moved over my target quite a lot so   here's the point I'm up fourteen thousand dollars 
and I'm clicking the button right now so I took my   partial that was my second trade in Tesla and as 
you can see the end result is over $27,000   in Tesla today and that's approximately what I had 
for all of my trades today, I mean I had a few more   trades but the end result is really two trades 
in Tesla today now again there's a big difference   between my first trade where I would expect a 
quick move down like what happened there with   the bear flag and the second trade where I'm just 
following the trend of the stock, now the market   did not really make a decision up to a point where 
it did start to come down and helped with my past   Tesla trade in fact Tesla reached close to my 
target before the market went down which means   Tesla is under pressure when I saw Tesla first 
moving down I noticed that there's some pressure   although the market was slowly moving higher not 
much really just slowly moving higher Tesla kept   coming down which indicates that there's a lot 
of sellers in Tesla and there's a lot of pressure   in Tesla and the way Tesla finally came down with 
the help of the market that helped me achieved my   target in Tesla which is more than my expected 
one-to-one risk award ratio and again a very nice   trade Tesla and Tesla did provide for me once 
more again well thank you very much for watching   this and if you do want to see more day trading

73,3iqdFdUBEug," Good morning it is Clay at claytrader.com This will be a live trade video, where I try to capture some of my trades as they play out live. Real quick, what do I mean by live in case maybe you're new to these videos, this is a situation where I
have not prerecorded anything. So I'm not doing like a trade
recap or a voiceover post commentary, nothing like that. This is a video where
I'm recording myself, seeing the information
for the very first time. So if you want raw thoughts,
raw emotions, raw reactions you are gonna get that here. If you just want a nicely edited video, nicely scripted video, then in the spirit of honoring your time, you're not gonna get that here. But if you just want a nitty
gritty look into what it's like to be a day trader, how
day trading can play out, then you will find that information here. I'm watching, or you will see that here. But as far as, see what I mean
about the no scripted part? Anyways, what I'm watching
right now is ticker symbol TSLA Tesla, maybe heard of it, but I think I'm gonna be watching that one moving forward. I had mentioned $680. So to give a little context here. Right here, if you're not familiar, I do offer, whoops, bring it over to, I was in the lounge where
people just chit-chat. But here in the, what is
called, we call the Trading Pit, much more stricter rules alerts only. But anyways point being
that 680 was that level that I was looking for at
the open as a flush point, meaning wanting to see the
price go down and believe it or not, you can make money
when prices go down, that's known as shorting, but as of now, Tesla has, looking over here you can see has separated itself out up quite a bit, $4 now above where it was. So maybe 680 won't be coming
into play. Maybe it will. It is Tesla, so it can move very quickly, but maybe a change of mind here. But then again, that's
just kinda how it goes. This is, I don't know what's coming next. So maybe I won't be trading. And just like that, AMC now popping up. So AMC, although. Oh yeah, AMC nice. So I dunno, we'll see. I think I'm still gonna be watching Tesla, but I suppose you never know,
market opens up in one minute. So I'm gonna go ahead and pause
the video and I'll be back at the open. And the markets are now open. So just a wait and see, looking
around at various, wow man, TK or TKAT, that thing's gonna get halted. Just thinking about 32 on that one, but these ones move so fast and I get it. Some people that is
their bread and butter, but I mean, so fast. Let's go back to Tesla here. This right here is the one minute chart, meaning this is candles
representing the first minute of a, you know, that that takes place. So, all right, well, I'm gonna go ahead and pause
right now and give some of these setups a little,
yeah, wow, look at that. So that's what I mean, TKAT
last I was looking at it, big old green candle, now it's moved down basically
$4 in the matter of minutes. So yeah, that's kinda why, like I said, some people do very well. Let's see. What is that? 686. could be interesting there. 636. We'll just do a hundred shares. 690. So that'd be four. Yeah, so I'm just talking
to myself right now. Tesla, I'm gonna get that alerted 686. Flush point one minute. If it comes into play here. Like I said, this might
be a legitimate bounce and if it is then so be it. Kind of moving down. In at 686. See if we can get it down below 685. There we go. So it took some up there. Took some more up there. See if we can get this now down below 684. Just waiting to see if we
can get some more bloodshed down below 684. Getting close. There we go. Good, good, good, good. And all out there for $166. Not bad for just a hundred shares. Hindsight. Yeah. Should have done more. But again, just to show you how that worked out, made the alert right
there in the chat room, Tesla 686 flush point. And had I done my normal
size of 300 shares, 200, 250 shares on Tesla. I mean, that would have been a bigger, bigger trade there, but again, it was so early in the day
I wanted to manage my risk a little bit there via
position size itself. So yeah, in hindsight, you know, that that could have been
easily, easily over $500, but I just went with the a
hundred shares because had that gone against me, then
that could have easily, easily been $500 loss, which I was not okay
with starting the day, but still walking away with a
nice little trade right there. So up 166 and a good kind
of real life example there of how the chat room works in case, 'cause I know a lot of people were always wondering about that. So there we go. And that one TK, that
one now halted. Yeah. So now that one's halted,
just like I said, I'm not, I'm not saying you shouldn't
trade stocks like this. I'm just saying for me and I, and I will trade sock
like this, but I, it just, it's just not quite. And looking at that Tesla right back up. So I'm very happy where I
pulled out those final profits, but I'm almost wondering,
do we have another, do we have another
opportunity here at 686? Maybe, I'm gonna let Tesla
play out a little bit more. All right. Well, there we go. Got a nice little trade there. And of course, like I said, the voice of you should have done more Clay. Why don't you do the more? You know, of course that
voice shows up just like, I'm sure it shows up to you, but you got to remember
the alternative of things, well had I been wrong that
could have been, you know, a bigger loss. 682.50 though, seems to be more so kind of that overall break point and then looking at the five
though, yep, five minute, meaning got to keep an eye on
that purple line there that's right where it bounced off of. I mean the power of
charts, check that out. Price went down there
and bounced right off of basically 681, we'll call it 50. So that's gonna be
another key area to watch. Even if the price does
break down below 682.50. But I am, let's see 682.50. What is that? Six, now that now that levels at 682. Might just be smart to wait to see if it can get down below 682. Would not be shocked to
see it bounce off 682 here. Did not bounce. Is this gonna be a true
breakdown though is the question. It's trying. But 682, that general area. Yeah. And that fast you can see the
prices bounce back above it. So that's why I didn't quite take that. May still go. I don't know if this one here. And CPNG, where did this one, what's the deal with this thing? Well, there's no shares to
short, so that's disappointing. Oh wow. Impressive move. Tesla's still kind of hanging there. All right. I will go
ahead and pause for now. I do like 682.50 here. If the price can come back
down to it, close enough. 682.58. Oh, whoops. I forgot to change my share price. All right. Well I have 25 shares. Forgot to change that back. So I guess we'll just
go with 25 shares then. Who knows? Maybe I'll
have lucked out here. What is that, 682. I will actually add. I'll add another 25 shares if it comes back down to 682.50. So let's keep an eye on it here. Watching very closely. 682.50 to add in another 50 shares. In there for another 25. So let's see if this thing
wants to give me that breakdown. Stop will be over 686. I'm almost wanna go in and
add in another 50 shares down at 682.50. I do. So we'll add in 50 more shares at 682.50, if it goes back down there, because this is just looking
like a beautiful setup here. Okay. Got those. Let's see if we can get
a little bit more down through 682 though. Wow. This 682 does not want to go. Do I want to add in some
more while it's moving back, I've already went down there. So let's see if we can
finally get the break of 682. So stubborn. Well, this now maybe a loss. Goes up over 686 I'll
have to get out, but okay. Now, should I add at 682 now? If it comes back down here, that would be yet
another failed move here. Choices, choices, choices. Come on. Just get down through 682. This is crazy. It should really plunge
if it can break that, there we go. There we go. There we go. Out there. Can we get down to 680 or
am I being a greedy savage? I think we can. That was
such a stubborn level. I think we should be able to
get some continuation from there to 680. There we go. Good. Took out another 25
there, still have 25 left. I should have added. Huh? I should have added
that, what a third time? Let's see if we can really
get some momentum here. Eh. All right. I'll take it. So right there up $353. And I mean, this will make me sound bad 'cause there was some skill involved in that 'cause I was adding, but there's also a little
bit of luck because I, by only adding or by only
entering with 25 shares 'cause I forgot to change my share size it allowed me to add
in a couple more times, which turned out to be a very nice trade and there it continues to go. But wow that was, that was kind of, kind of annoying eight, 682
was, it was not budging, not budging, not budging,
but when it did finally go, there we go. So it is 12 minutes into the day. I'm up $350. Pretty crazy. I'm not sure many places in the world you can make $350 in
12 minutes, but I mean, I want to be done soon. I want to move on with my day, but I mean, it's been
only 12 minutes, so I'll, I'll look around, look for
another trade and yeah. Yeah. I'm just thinking
from a video perspective. I'm glad I decided to record
because that was a pretty cool one actually just,
'cause I love the setup. The setup kept getting better and better, which is why I kept adding. But that one time when
I was, that final time, should I add again? I was a little nervous. Do I want to add again
and then have this thing? And that's the time where I, I definitely should have added
probably another 50 shares at that point, but good
old hindsight there. Have you ever been there making a bunch of money in hindsight? So all right. Well, let me take a look around some more. Well, I'm looking at TKAT
for maybe a $30 break, but I think this one is
just, can it get above 30? Yup. There it goes. Yeah, that's just, I mean, I,
look, I alerted this one here. Just made a comment of how it
looks good coming out of the pull back consolidation is true. I mean, totally looked good, but I, it also for me looked at
just not quite fitting what I'm looking at and
I get it in hindsight. Yeah, you should have taken the trade, but there's just that feeling, you know, if you don't feel right about something, then you don't want to put
yourself into the trade because you're gonna freak yourself out. And for me, that one just
was not sitting right for me, even though the chart pattern
looked great, you know, that's only half the battle. The other part of the battle
is your own psyche, right? Your a human mind, your human psyche, now again, it's halted. What do I mean by halted? Well, you look right here and you can see that nothing is going on. So that's what a halted stock looks like. But your human psyche
is very important too. So just keep that in mind. And Tesla just keeps
on, keeps on bleeding. Now I realize, well, what
are you talking about Clay? Tesla's a crazy, crazy stock. And that's actually a more than valid. That's a very fair assessment, but I have a lot of
experience trading Tesla. I'm watching Tesla every
single day. So it is volatile. Yes, but I, because I do watch it so much, I'm very familiar. You know, stocks have personality
and the more you trade and especially the more you
watch a particular stock, you get to know that these
stocks do behave in certain ways. And because I do have so
much experience with Tesla, you know, it's not like
I'm always perfect on it, but it's not really as
volatile as what it may seem because I understand and
I've seen it trade enough to kind of realize
what's going on with it. But we're, as far as TKAT I have no idea if I've ever traded that stock, I don't even know if I've ever
heard of that stock before. So there's just totally, there's no familiarity with
it and that can prevent, you know, prevent, present, there we go. There is the word I'm looking
for. present problems also. See what I mean about not
being scripted? But anyways. All right, well, I will
go ahead and pause. All right, I'm liking Tesla
here at 675 and I'm good, there we go. So all out there for a quick, quick skelp, that all happened very quickly I understand, but I just took the $150. 'Cause I don't know if
this downwards trend, let me just bring over the five minute. Not quite sure if this is really wanting to get down further. I like the chances of
it at least testing 673. So I was giving myself plenty
of wiggle room by just being okay with 674.50 on the skelp. 'Cause like I said, I think it, at least
that wants to test 673. But again, by just getting out at 67450, that gave myself plenty of leeway. So if I was wrong, which I was wrong because
it never did hit 673, I was still able to make
money on it because I didn't, I wasn't planning like the best
case scenario I was saying, okay, I think that has a
high chance of happening, but I mean, it might not happen. So how can I still make money from it? And you just saw that right there. By making it just a,
be a very small skelp. So yes, I thought it had
a chance at that point of going down to 673, but I was wrong because
you can see right here, it's actually bouncing back up. However, I didn't need
to be totally right. I just needed it to be little bit right. In order to make 150 bucks. And because I was a little bit right, I'm still walking away with a hundred, $150 on that trade. And then overall I am now up, and now I can throw this
screen again right there. $504 with commissions, I don't
know, probably right around, 'cause I was trading such
small share sizes that I've probably right around
500 bucks on the day. So yeah, $500 in basically 20 minutes. I am more than happy with that. Again. I'm not saying any
of this to brag, but yeah, $500 in 20 minutes. I'm not sure if many places in the world where you can make that happen. So I am definitely gonna call it good. And you know, again, my
approach is to be done in 30. I mean, I want to on average
would be done everyday after 30 minutes so I can get out there, because I do this for freedom of time. Trading is a side hustle for
me and I don't want to do it because I need a private jet or a yacht. If that's what you want, go for it. I hope you get it. For me, I just want to
have freedom of time. I want to be able to go do what I want with my family right now. I'm actually at one of my
investment properties in Northern Michigan sits over on over 300 acres. So yeah, I'm gonna go out. I'm gonna have some adventures with my, with my kids now and we're gonna have a go have a good time. See if we can find on, there's always something
to do on over 300 acres. We're gonna go do that. But
so that's all I have for you. If you do enjoy these
videos really quickly, a couple of things, first off hit that like button and then leave a quick comment. Even if it's just a thumbs up emoji, these are truly live. So they're not the easiest videos to make. I will keep making them as long as I know that you liked them. But when I have to talk to you, make alerts in the chat room,
you know, think for myself, operate the trade. I mean, you saw the one mistake where I forgot to change
my order size back. So there's just a lot going on. So they're not the easiest videos to make, but they're totally doable
and I will keep doing them as long as I know that you enjoy them. So like I said, if you do enjoy them, you can communicate that to
me in two very easy ways: hitting the like button,
leaving a quick comment, even if it's simply just
the thumbs up emoji, those two things go a long way. So thanks for hanging out and
a lot of good mini-lessons in this one I would say, in
terms of trade management, just avoiding stocks, if you're not quite familiar with them, if they make you nervous and
just always finding something that you do feel confident
in because hey, I avoided, you know, the one that
could have made me a lot, but I still am walking away
with 500 bucks in 20 minutes. So I'm happy with that. So I'm actually super
excited about this video, especially that Tesla trade,
that a stubborn, stubborn, what was that? 282 up right here, waiting and waiting, waiting for it to fall
and then it finally did. But overall thank you for hanging out. Hit that like button leave
a quick little comment. First off thanks so much for
watching the entire video. Real quick, before you go, I want to invite you to a live
webinar web class training workshop, online event,
whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you. What I discovered that has
allowed me to transform myself from being an employee,
to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total. I'm gonna cover three keys
that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way, the second key is super awesome
because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans,
making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes
a pitfall for many traders. I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the
pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key
when you hear it sounds way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works. Then at the end, I open it up for a question
and answer session that is again, totally live. Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up
as it will be recorded. And you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you. Click the image on the
screen or click the link down in the description box. So you can get the date and
time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited
due to the fact that this truly is a live event. If you have any questions, let me know. If not, I'll be seeing you soon.",TSLA,"['Good', 'morning', 'it', 'is', 'Clay', 'at', 'claytrader', 'com', 'This', 'will', 'be', 'a', 'live', 'trade', 'video', 'where', 'I', 'try', 'to', 'capture',

74,KiOy-z8CG-Q," Hey everybody this is Tammy the Fibonacci 
Princess from the Fibonacci room here at Simpler   Trading I just thought I would give you a quick 
update on Tesla I normally do not cover Tesla   because that is one of the ones that Carolyn 
the Queen does but since she is on vacation   a few days this week I thought I would go ahead 
and let you know some resistance some two-step   resistance that I see because that is one of the 
 Fibonacci trading setups that we look for  is a two-step so the two-step pattern is coming 
from that low from the fifth of March to this high   to this more recent low it's also an extension off 
of this high to this low that comes in at 752.35   and then we do have a 618 retracement 
from this overall high to low right here   that completes the two-step pattern so 
that's coming in 752 to 0.35 and 769 to 0.37   and with Tesla we are above the 200 but we 
are above below the 50. the 5 and the 13   just crossed over to a buy so that is good that we 
now have three of the moving averages on our side   as far as a bullish setup is concerned however   I do want you to watch out for this resistance 
on the way up and it happens to correlate with   that 50-day moving average so I want you to 
please be a cautious bull when it comes to Tesla   all right everybody that's what I've got for you 
all for Tesla for now I actually have got let's   see I do have some support here on the 30-minute 
chart so I can go ahead and share that with you   also I am sharing Tesla live in the 
room right now also because the queen   is out but this is what I'm looking at 
on the 30-minute chart the setup zone is 682.14 to 685.41   on that 30 minute chart and if that low from 
today is any good your target is going to be 7 14   54 which also correlates with the second target 
of that high to low swing which is at 7 12 81 all right everybody I hope you have an awesome 
rest of the day and if you are not in the room   with us right now please come and join us 
and I will talk to you soon thanks bye-bye   without Simpler Trading I could not have 
financial in the past this is one of the best   investments I ever made in my life it's helping 
me find consistency one of the things that won me",TSLA,"['Hey', 'everybody', 'this', 'is', 'Tammy', 'the', 'Fibonacci', 'Princess', 'from', 'the', 'Fibonacci', 'room', 'here', 'at', 'Simpler', 'Trading', 'I', 'just', 'thought', 'I', 'would', 'give', 'you', 'a', 'quick', 'update', 'on', 'Tesla', 'I', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'cover', 'Tesla', 'because', 'that', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'ones', 'that', 'Carolyn', 'the', 'Queen', 'does', 'but', 'since', 'she', 'is', 'on', 'vacation', 'a', 'few', 'days', 'this', 'week', 'I', 'thought', 'I', 'would', 'go', 'ahead', 'and', 'let', 'you', 'know', 'some', 'resistance', 'some', 'two', 'step', 'resistance', 'that', 'I', 'see', 'because', 'that', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'Fibonacci', 'trading', 'setups', 'that', 'we', 'look', 'for', 'is', 'a', 'two', 'step', 'so', 'the', 'two', 'step', 'pattern', 'is', 'coming', 'from', 'that', 'low', 'from', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'March', 'to', 'this', 'high', 'to', 'this', 'more', 'recent', 'low', 'it', 's', 'also', 'an', 'extension', 'off', 'of', 'this', 'high', 'to', 'this', 'low', 'that', 'comes', 'in', 'at', '752', '35', 'and', 'then', 'we', 'do', 'have', 'a', '618', 'retracement', 'from', 'this', 'overall', 'high', 'to', 'low', 'right', 'here', 'that', 'completes', 'the', 'two', 'step', 'pattern', 'so', 'that', 's', 'coming', 'in', '752', 'to', '0', '35', 'and', '769', 'to', '0', '37', 'and', 'with', 'Tesla', 'we', 'are', 'above', 'the', '200', 'but', 'we', 'are', 'above', 'below', 'the', '50', 'the', '5', 'and', 'the', '13', 'just', 'crossed', 'over', 'to', 'a', 'buy', 'so', 'that', 'is', 'good', 'that', 'we', 'now', 'have', 'three', 'of', 'the', 'moving', 'averages', 'on', 'our', 'side', 'as', 'far', 'as', 'a', 'bullish', 'setup', 'is', 'concerned', 'however', 'I', 'do', 'want', 'you', 'to', 'watch', 'out', 'for', 'this', 'resistance', 'on', 'the', 'way', 'up', 'and', 'it', 'happens', 'to', 'correlate', 'with', 'that', '50', 'day', 'moving', 'average', 'so', 'I', 'want', 'you', 'to', 'please', 'be', 'a', 'cautious', 'bull', 'when', 'it', 'comes', 'to', 'Tesla', 'all', 'right', 'everybody', 'that', 's', 'what', 'I', 've', 'got', 'for', 'you', 'all', 'for', 'Tesla', 'for', 'now', 'I', 'actually', 'have', 'got', 'let', 's', 'see', 'I', 'do', 'have', 'some', 'support', 'here', 'on', 'the', '30', 'minute', 'chart', 'so', 'I', 'can', 'go', 'ahead', 'and', 'share', 'that', 'with', 'you', 'also', 'I', 'am', 'sharing', 'Tesla', 'live', 'in', 'the', 'room', 'right', 'now', 'also', 'because', 'the', 'queen', 'is', 'out', 'but', 'this', 'is', 'what', 'I', 'm', 'looking', 'at', 'on', 'the', '30', 'minute', 'chart', 'the', 'setup', 'zone', 'is', '682', '14', 'to', '685', '41', 'on', 'that', '30', 'minute', 'chart', 'and', 'if', 'that', 'low', 'from', 'today', 'is', 'any', 'good', 'your', 'target', 'is', 'going', 'to', 'be', '7', '14', '54', 'which', 'also', 'correlates', 'with', 'the', 'second', 'target', 'of', 'that', 'high', 'to', 'low', 'swing', 'which', 'is', 'at', '7', '12', '81', 'all', 'right', 'everybody', 'I', 'hope', 'you', 'have', 'an', 'awesome', 'rest', 'of', 'the', 'day', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'not', 'in', 'the', 'room', 'with', 'us', 'right', 'now', 'please', 'come', 'and', 'join', 'us', 'and', 'I', 'will', 'talk', 'to', 'you', 'soon', 'thanks', 'bye', 'bye', 'without', 'Simpler', 'Trading', 'I', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'financial', 'in', 'the', 'past', 'this', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'best', 'investments', 'I', 'ever', 'made', 'in', 'my', 'life', 'it', 's', 'helping', 'me', 'find', 'consistency', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'things', 'that', 'won', 'me']"
