1,mmMIusfGcOc, so maybe you've heard about meme stocks and if you haven't this is either your first very very first day in the markets or you've been living under a rock today we're going to talk about meme stocks and why you should care and why it's going to be the theme for quite some time [Music] hey everyone lee train with stocks of trade tim bowen here be sure to like subscribe and share these videos with your friends um you know i talk about the democratization of trading so much i mean listen trading's been opening up opening up opening up getting more and more accessible to joe and jane everyday trader for the last couple years but now with this democratization this you know open access to information a super computer in your pocket commission free trading there's never been a better time to get into trading so ring that bell to be notified every time we go live every time we drop a podcast we're putting out a bunch of great information here and if you're really ready to take your trading the next level check out the steady trade team i do twice daily webinars every single trading day there is so much going on right now i tell you the biggest issue the it's funny how things have flipped because it used to be as a new trader one of your biggest impediments to success was lack of information it's the opposite now there is so much going on so much information out there it's coming at you from everywhere heck your grandma's probably talking to you about stocks right now okay steady trade team we filter it all down twice daily live webinars and focus on what really matters check out the steady trade team look forward to working with you all right so meme stocks uh you know diamond hands together apes are strong to the moon you know all these memes and things you've been seeing number one it's awesome i love it because uh you know you maybe if you listen to the podcast you know since i was a kid i've always been yeah i've called myself a stock market dork and when you're a dork when you're a nerd by the way i consider dork and nerd compliments i don't consider those derogatory terms if you're a wine nerd if you're a coffee nerd if you're a cigar nerd or a stock market nerd i consider that a compliment it just means you really love something and you love getting into all intricate details of it but that being said the memes are just amazing and it's so it makes trading so much more fun and now let's talk about how you really apply this okay how do you make some money with this that's why you're here you're trying to make some money you're trying to grow your account supplement your income pay for a vacation whatever well as much as i love the meme stocks and the whole you know diamond hands and hold the line and all this stuff what this is creating is so much opportunity for you if you are that nerd or that dork that really wants to learn this stuff okay and that's one of the things i talk about a lot that listen i don't think you should be actively day trading unless you're in love unless you're obsessed i mean i'm obsessed if you follow the channel i mean every morning every single morning i show up here rant and rave you know go nuts about the action of the day i think you can tell my passion if you listen to the podcast um you know the steady trade podcast like the number one complaint for the steady trade podcast is tim never shuts up i just love talking stocks i love this stuff and if you're that nerd and you're into this stuff there's so many more uninformed investors people that aren't putting in the time people that aren't tracking their trades they're not doing the spreadsheets at night you know they're just the yolo people and i'm not here to pass a moral judgment you know listen if young people want to throw some money at the market i'm not going to yell at him i mean listen when i was 18 19 20 the stuff i wasted money on you know putting a thousand dollar stereo in a car that was worth 500 bucks you know it's like listen i made plenty of bad decisions from 18 to 20 to 22 to 25 you know and here's the thing if you do yolo maybe you'll learn from it at least but you're not a yolo peep you're you're actually watching youtube videos you want to learn you want to get better so the point is study take advantage of this youtube channel take advantage of the podcast check out the stocks of trade blog uh you know listen there's a bunch of videos on our channel where i review books recommend books there's so much information out there and if you can be diligent and focused there's never been more dumb money out there and the dump the more dumb money there is the more the edge to the people that take it serious and listen gme amazing going from four dollars to you know 400 in the matter of um you know a few months and i mean really vertically went from 20 to 4 almost 500 in the matter of a week but we all know what most of them are gonna do none of them have a plan none of them have a stop and they might have bought it 200 300 heck they might have bought it 50 i mean and sitting on a huge unrealized gain so think about that that person that doesn't have that trade plan and they bought it at 50 and here they are up 200 a share maybe they got like 10 shares you know they got they bought 10 shares at 50 a 500 position here they are you know sitting at at 2 500 a 2 000 gain on a 500 position and they're not selling you know because they they believe the memes they believe that gamestop has long term potential they think it's going to ten thousand you know now listen anything can happen in this market but the biggest point i want to talk about is we always talk about that three to one risk to reward having realistic goals and here's the thing let's say you are and i'm not saying anybody bought you know 10 well somebody probably did but if you bought 10 shares at 50 and here you are sitting with a 400 percent gain 500 percent gain you take that gains you book it and then here's the thing if gme let's say who knows by the time this video comes out usually there's a weak lag until the video gets published you know if it breaks out at 500 we buy you can always trade in and out of these things that's the beauty of liquid stocks like this thing i mean i mean trading hundreds of millions of shares you can get in and out plenty of liquidity anytime you want so there's no reason to become that true believer or that bag holder or that trader with no plan and if you simply have a goal and a stop okay i know a lot of you are probably taking this seriously that's why you're on the channel you'd be amazed how many people they enter a trade and it's like what's your stop that i don't know you know uh i'll stop if it goes against me what's that mean and then well when are you selling what's your goal well you know i'll sell when it spikes you know and those vague you know so because the reason they're vague i mean it's some quarter it's probably some sort of psychological thing that gives them that ability to enter you know to stay in a trade when the when it when it doesn't go their way or when it does go their way and then it allows them to basically weasel out something that i've taught forever write it down on an index card and i mean i know most of us are on laptops now but back in when i would when i was getting started trading you know i had a desktop so i had the function keys on the top of my keyboard i would enter or write down my entry my goal and my stop and i would stick it in that function key row of my keyboard and it was staring me in the face so that when my stop started slipping that index card is telling me you're an idiot you're not sticking to your discipline you're not actually trading you're just hoping you're hoping it goes up you're hoping if it goes against you it bounces hope and hope and hoping you know whether it's in your favor or not in your favor and hope is not a strategy okay that is not a strategy a strategy is buying gme at 250 selling or buying it at 50 selling it at 150 selling it at 200 not holding up to 480 and then let it come all the way back to 50 or 40 or 30 or 20 or all the way back to five bucks where it started so have a trade plan stick to it build good habits okay telling you if you've ever tried to get in shape or lose weight that momentum builds day one you know you exercise and maybe you miss a day then you hit it then you do two days in a row then you do three days in a row then you start eating better then you start drinking your water and that momentum builds and all of a sudden you look back and you're 20 pounds lighter or your cardio is 10 times better or your bench is that much higher or whatever your goal is consistent daily good habits taking this seriously again i love the memes nobody loves the memes more than i do but i take this seriously it's real money it's real trading things can go bad fast just as bad as they are just as quickly as they can go good all right everyone love the memes give me a comment below what's your favorite one um i do kind of like the uh many apes or apes strong together it's one of my favorite ones but anyway have a great day everyone check out the steady trade team be serious this is gonna be the greatest year ever of trading and heck at this point when you look at the way i mean wall street bets has added like six million people this week i've done so many videos saying a year ago i was doing videos saying everyone's a trader everyone's a trader today so much opportunity and if you get that education and you build those habits i i don't think there's ever been a better time to to be in that 10 percent to succeed because of the fact that you can study and there's just so much more dumb money out there so all right everyone check out the steady trade team and i look for,"['so', 'maybe', 'you', 've', 'heard', 'about', 'meme', 'stocks', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'haven', 't',

6,a3WnvDtDD2M, I accidentally became a meme and this is that story my name is Andres Erato that people might know me as hide the pain Herald before taking stock photos I was working as an electric engineer my specialty was lighting technologies the stock photos began when a photographic contacted me when he saw my selfies on the social media and he was saying that he was seeking a character like me and invited me to shoot some images this happened almost 10 years ago after the first photo shoots the photographer really liked the pictures so he righted me back several times I was for instance a doctor a university professor husband a painter and many others I first realised when I had become a meme several months after the first photo shoots I was curious but my pictures were used for so I made a reverse image search and I discovered myself in different advertisements as a professor or or a doctor but some months later when I repeated that search I discovered the first mean and that was the point when I realized that I had became at first it was horrifying when I encountered the first means because there was some really rude or disgusting jokes with me so I wanted to please throw all the pictures and close down all the website that they appeared but that was not a real solution it took several years they'd like to accept the situation but it has brought me several new opportunities at first people didn't believe that I'm a real living person they thought the memes were trying to Photoshop creation when I embraced this I revealed my identity on a Russian social media site and after that I can say that for the bad or rude or disgusting needs disappeared at first I did not consider myself as famous but later more and more people stopped me on the street asking for a selfie I do this always willingly because I see the joy in the eyes of these people and it's so good to make other people happy I had the opportunity to cooperate with the biggest brands like coca-cola they invited me for a shooting when I had to fly in a wind tunnel it was very very exciting I enjoyed it very much now there is a much bigger challenge inside a comedy movie about the high the pain story my management is planning and talking with potential investors surprisingly I got lots of messages each day on my Facebook and Instagram channels from people asking for help in the everyday life I try to show to my fans that they should be happy even during the difficult times in their lives and I guess memes can have in these periods to overcome the everyday annoyances even though this unexpected event happened I still consider myself the same old guy and Roger Otto [Music],"['I', 'accidentally', 'became', 'a', 'meme', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'that', 'story', 'my', 'name',

7,p7HKvqRI_Bo," In the 1600s the Dutch East India Company 
employed hundreds of ships to trade gold, porcelain, spices, 
and silks around the globe. But running this massive 
operation wasn’t cheap. In order to fund their expensive voyages, the company turned to private citizens– individuals who could invest money 
to support the trip in exchange for a share 
of the ship’s profits. This practice allowed the company 
to afford even grander voyages, increasing profits for both 
themselves and their savvy investors. Selling these shares in coffee houses 
and shipping ports across the continent, the Dutch East India Company unknowingly
invented the world’s first stock market. Since then, companies have been 
collecting funds from willing investors to support all kinds of businesses. And today, the stock market has schools, careers,
and even whole television channels dedicated to understanding it. But the modern stock market is 
significantly more complicated than its original incarnation. So how do companies and investors
use the market today? Let’s imagine a new coffee company 
that decides to launch on the market. First, the company will advertise itself 
to big investors. If they think the company is a good idea, they get the first crack at investing, and then sponsor the company’s initial 
public offering, or IPO. This launches the company onto the 
official public market, where any company or individual who 
believes the business could be profitable might buy a stock. Buying stocks makes those investors 
partial owners in the business. Their investment helps 
the company to grow, and as it becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential 
and start buying stocks. As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price, increasing 
the cost for prospective buyers, and raising the value of the company's 
stocks people already own. For the company, this increased interest helps 
fund new initiatives, and also boosts its overall market value by showing how many people 
are willing to invest in their idea. However, if for some reason a company 
starts to seem less profitable the reverse can also happen. If investors think their stock 
value is going to decline, they’ll sell their stocks with the hopes 
of making a profit before the company loses more value. As stocks are sold and demand 
for the stock goes down, the stock price falls, and with it, the company’s market value. This can leave investors with big losses– unless the company starts to look 
profitable again. This see-saw of supply and demand 
is influenced by many factors. Companies are under the unavoidable 
influence of market forces– such as the fluctuating 
price of materials, changes in production technology, and the shifting costs of labor. Investors may be worried about 
changes in leadership, bad publicity, or larger factors like 
new laws and trade policies. And of course, plenty of investors are simply ready 
to sell valuable stocks and pursue personal interests. All these variables cause day-to-day noise
in the market, which can make companies appear more
or less successful. And in the stock market, appearing to lose value often leads 
to losing investors, and in turn, losing actual value. Human confidence in the market has the
power to trigger everything from economic booms 
to financial crises. And this difficult-to-track 
variable is why most professionals promote 
reliable long term investing over trying to make quick cash. However, experts are constantly 
building tools in efforts to increase their 
chances of success in this highly unpredictable system. But the stock market is not just 
for the rich and powerful. With the dawn of the Internet, everyday investors can buy stocks in many of the exact same ways 
a large investor would. And as more people educate themselves 
about this complex system they too can trade stocks, support the businesses they believe in, and pursue their financial goals. The first step is getting invested.","['In', 'the', '1600s', 'the', 'Dutch', 'East', 'India', 'Company', 'employed', 'hundreds', 'of', 'ships', 'to', 'trade', 'gold', 'porcelain', 'spices', 'and',

8,ndcDT1rXMvU, hey guys today on it's alive we're making a little master stock it's a recipe you can actually find on bone Appetit comm one that I made it's a version of a chicken stock meets a pork stock meets a it's just a master stock okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] look he's got some gnarly going on brother than this yeah bud go see spiders some funky crabs I don't know Andy he's doing so right off the bat we got some turkey wings and some chicken wings roaster off ahead of time all right when did that she would always have to sit around for 45 minutes or whatever it took a little bit of salt light a little bit of olive oil and just kind of roasted them get a little color on their colors gonna bring to your stock a some color obviously it's gonna bring a darker color to the liquid of the broth but it's also gonna add some flavor any time you brown some or cook it like that searing a steak is where you pick up that my yard reaction and that's just gonna give it a little bit more depth a little bit more of a a little bit of a sense of Amami throughout it you know a little bit more richness all right so that's our meat Oh thought you'd never ask the secret ingredient let me grab these bad boys right here take package real quick all right smoked ham hocks these are fantastic on their own that's one of my I love eating these you know just braised with some beans or something smokey picky real gelatinous see real sticky just basically if I was a pig leg unless I'm wrong I believe them right so it's kind of like the little jointiy ankle so to say and this is just a great bang for your buck for for for stock making let's start we got it we got our stock pot all right put that on it'll put that on a little medium medium heat a little bit of olive oil all right so look we got some cremini mushrooms you can use any kind of mushroom shiitake but in whatever I'm gonna go using anything too fancy don't go throwing your matsutakes in this one I mean ya can but just maybe a little unnecessary shiitake actually works great if you can I would recommend getting shiitake we got some cremini because it's just what it is okay look boom great in the bowl oh heavens I hate this now there was a study about whether or not you need to wash mushrooms something you know the rule was always if you wash them they pick up moisture and they never really Brown just brush it off you know which is cool and that's fine and you can do that but I remember reading somewhere that they did like a side by side study where they like soaked some and then brush them and then they went to go like saute him after and I guess they both picked up I get long story short is that there was like not much of a major difference in the ones that were washed versus unwashed so hope you learned something here I think the recipe calls for two medium carrots this is like a horse carrot these are kind of medium I'm going to nip off the little nib ins here the little tops and then that's it okay boom maybe we'll do a little half a little chunker's like that and this is great you know we all know someone who's got I'm gonna cook dinner I'm gonna do whatever and they use a little half onion and then they'll put it in the fridge or they'll put it wherever and eventually it kind of unless you use it sometimes it just saves just shrinks up and dies in vain so what I like to do is a use them but then big this is a great spot for your stock I'll nip that off I didn't like that skins and all skins add a little flavor and color to pull them right in there and they've got a nice little fresh e here look I cut it right in half whack a towel beautiful huh hello right I know you brought me coffee you shouldn't have we're gonna make a little master stock we're it's turkey chicken and and smoked ham hocks we give it a little bit of smoky flavor a little bit of porkiness but also like big gelatinous because it's knuckle II there's a lot of big knuckle in there oh so I cut this onion in half we're gonna throw it in our mirepoix Ben and then same with the garlic okay you don't need the skin um or nothing so it depends what you're doing for this application I just cut right in half like so see this is booboo garlic you see all that green wow it's not the best it's well most of it you get in the supermarket is kind of BS because it was picked so long ago and what that is is it's the germ so the GAR trying to grow because these are like the seeds right look you pop a little clove in the ground before I cut it in half boom right in the ground it grows the chute and then eventually this is what's under well thanks for stopping by ciao for now so we got a minute oh just do no celery there is let me go grab I'll go grab a couple stalks of celery okay oh here come with me take a field trip Oh Gaby watch your back yeah let's hit the road after you Oh Rachel carton award-winning social media member from bone Appetit whoa salary huh yeah traumatizing story about suffer

that that someone bought us so we can make this video but I can't support instead of freezing them i'ma throw a few more in there raw we roasted the other ones these were gonna put in raw yeah yeah buddy get ready in there and the rest I'll freeze for when we make a bad batch in a couple months when Gaby collects enough bones and she's like Brad I wish you would make stock I don't feel good all right now I'll bring this back over yeah that's the stuff I'll put it on high now go ahead bring that to a good bubble you know a good heavy simmer so we got all of our ingredients simmering away that's gonna take about four or five hours it's getting a little late in the day all right honey why don't you get out of here right I'll carry this home and when I'm done I'll pop that in the wok and we'll let it hang out and when we regroup cuz we got a couple things to do over the next couple days once it's all set up in the walk-in it can sit there for a couple days no big deal well come back say on Thursday days Monday and we'll heat it up we'll strain it will taste it we'll talk stock we'll see you then get out everybody out [Music] coming out Hansie and we're back pull the stock out of the fridge really happy with it come on get your eyes in here we got a nice little jiggle going bud we got a nice little jelly setup nice all that all that collagen and gelatin from the pork and from the turkey from the chicken that's nice I like stock that sets up into gel okay that's a sign of success for me now there's some fat on there you could you could leave that on if you want no big deal I'm just going to scoop a little bit of it off if you want to like render it down in there's sometimes some kind of weird schmaltzy porky schmaltz you think knock yourself out I'm not going to well because we don't have time all right but that's alright that's how we roll right hungie running gun babe what do we need boom timeslots just slip a min who cares yeah I'm just gonna get some of that off and there's your product no we can't show that JA what do you think hungry bud no okay but it's not it just looks disgusting pie smells like Turkey like turkey water look this is where we got John yeah well jiggle jiggle butter yeah so we're gonna warm it up strain it cored it up pack it up Oh stick around Johnny boy all right to the heat now I'm just gonna let it come to the heat up just a little bit not hot but just too so it's not jelly any more we're gonna strain it we're tore it up pack it up store it in the freezer make soup it's kind of it but what I like to do for consumption you know obviously the soups or the pasta dishes or whatever you're doing I like to just drink it - who turned me on to that was old Brian Merkel you might know him from hot coal he's a he's a butcher out in Duluth and we go to Montana almost every year oh and we snowboard and we cook and one day and we made this big batch of stock and he brought this vacuum pack thing it was like tumeric and ginger and he had a fermented paste and he goes off all fermented paste and in the morning we would get our mugs and we fill it with this gelatinous he stock and put a dollop of that fermented turmeric paste in there I'm gonna eat that any day any day of the week wish I had it right now oh that's what we'll do next all right episode coming soon it's live we're gonna do tumeric garlic ginger paste for enhancing your bone broths which I don't like I don't like call it a bone broth it's just good stock so stock enhancer coming soon oh you know what I want to do I was talking old babby this morning Oh Benji himself and he was asking me if I had a freeze dryer and I was like oh I I thought it was just like liquid nitrogen you did things in apparently not it's like a vacuum thing with some type of thing I don't know but it got the wheels turning and I love freeze-dried fruit I don't know that little clever cooks up too but I'm gonna get can we get it we kind of need a freeze drying machine so we can make freeze-dried anything we could do freeze-dried fruits freeze-dried Kevin's [Music] snack of all Kevin stackable please try all types of stuff so coming to breakfast stock enhancers and freeze-dried everything's okay we only put a pinch of salt in I like to kind of keep it a little neutral with the salt because um you can always add it you know maybe you didn't want it so if you're making soup season the taste you're gonna do whatever else with your stock season the taste Oh a little breakfast stock season the taste what time we have till 1:30 oh you're plenty of time dad so now you could just go dumping this all in the strainer but that's kind of silly we drew all the nutrients out of it already so now it's just kind of like dead protein I guess and like fiber and sometimes I eat it right like you kind of just want to like don't that look good but it's not that good oh yeah those ham hocks that's the gelatin we were looking for nice broken down get it out let us have it goop city bugs but that's what we're looking for stuff make it live to be 120 now we can go to the strainer oh damn it it's fine cheesecloth I forgot to hold it you know no one's perfect we try all you can do is try to be better next time Lewis color beautiful this is the stuff liquid gold here you know what let's just try pouring it see how it goes you know let's live a little Oh oh yeah that felt right oh yeah that's the shot oh it looks so bad looks like oh yeah cleanly we cleaned out the dishwasher and this is fun this is terrible this is true though when the city gets too much rain and the drainage systems can't handle it they just open up the gates and it all just goes sewage everything goes right out to the ocean it's disgusting it's true though it's true Rhoda bro did you get a haircut looks delightful the lovely Rhoda Boone everyone take the stuff up Oh chill it will freeze it get yourself a little chest freezer stock up ha ha no pun intended let's give it a little taste i heated some up little extra ok ooh delightful John you want a try but let me get you something mmm yeah it just needs salt oh it's wonderful nice roasted flavor right it's dude thank you even a little

9,ncV0Nw9VSo8," - [Instructor] How's it going today, guys? Welcome back to the channel. Hope you're having a great day so far. So, in this video today, we're
going to be doing a update on my M1 Finance dividend stock portfolio. Now, real quick, guys,
I just want to mention that I just moved to my new
property in Miami, Florida. I ended up moving for
lifestyle and tax reasons. So I don't fully have
my office set up yet, but I'm hoping to have that soon. So I might have a couple of videos here where it's just a screen recording, simply because I don't
have my office set up yet. But I still wanted to make sure that I was putting out
good content for you guys. So, that being said, one
of my goals for this year is to be way more consistent with my portfolio update series, because a lot of people, I think, get so much value from this, and I've been getting
more requests for that. So, basically, every single
month, I'm gonna update you on the progress of this portfolio, on YouTube, as well as
Instagram reels, and on TikTok. And we're gonna be talking
about all different things on each of those different platforms, so I highly encourage you to follow along. Also guys, just to cover this, this is not any kind of
financial advice here, guys. I am not a financial advisor, and you should always do
your own due diligence above and beyond this video before making your own
investing decisions. Also, I am affiliated with M1 Finance, so, if you want to give
back to me for this content, you can feel free to use that link below. Now, that being said, guys, my portfolio has been on
a bit of a tear lately, and this is the all-time high that this portfolio has ever been. Now, for context, I'm gonna
show you guys right here, I actually started this portfolio, it was a little bit over a year
ago, on January 6th of 2020. That is when I put my
first couple of dollars in this portfolio. And a lot of the reason
why I've had so many, so much money gained from this portfolio is based on the time period
when I was investing, which was largely during the pandemic, during this period right here. So, before the pandemic
was really even over, I had invested about 50
grand into the market, which really helped me get
some exceptionally good prices on many of the stocks in my portfolio. But we're gonna continue this series here, even though it's well beyond
a $100,000 stock portfolio. We're just gonna see how
big we can build this thing. So, I encourage you guys to
subscribe and follow along. Also, real quick, guys, I
just want to say thank you to today's video's sponsor, which is me. And that is because I literally
just spent an entire month of my life creating this
video that you see right here, called, ""Stock Market For Beginners 2021."" No, your eyes are not deceiving you. This is a three hour and
17 minute long video, that's literally a
step-by-step presentation on pretty much everything that
I know in the stock market. So I'm gonna put a link down
in the description for this, and a card in the corner. If you've been watching any of my content in the last five years, guys, this is the most valuable
video I have ever uploaded on YouTube, hands down. And if you do jump over
and watch this video, just leave me a comment that says, ""Came from M1 Finance video,"" because I'm always curious if
people actually follow along when I make these suggestions. So, highly recommend that, guys. I would love for you to check it out. I think there's tons of value there. And it's been one of the
biggest projects I've done so far this year. But that being said, guys, the main focus of this video here, aside from just updating
you on the stocks, is that I ended up
rebalancing this portfolio. And I'm going to explain what that means a little bit in this video. And during that process of rebalancing, I ended up adding three
brand-new stocks to my portfolio, and I'm not gonna click-bait you guys. I'm gonna tell you what
those three stocks are now. Number one is Texas Instruments. The second stock that I added was Walmart. And the third and final
stock I added is Logitech. And I'll give you a little
bit of reasoning behind those in a bit, but I essentially
rebalanced my portfolio because some of the stocks
in my portfolio had gone up so much, so fast, I was
starting to get concerned, and I wanted to start taking
some profits off the table. In particular, that was
happening with one stock here, which was Bank of America. I ended up investing in this stock during, over the summer, I believe. If I click in here, it should tell me when I made my initial
purchasing, if I can find that. So I ended up buying Bank of
America stock over the summer. And as you can see here, my average price per share was $23.86. And this is now almost a $40 stock. So, that's a really wild return to have in a very short period of time. And if we look at the last year here, you can see where, oh,
this is where I rebalanced. So you can see where the value went from 15, 16,000, down to nine, because basically, what
M1 Finance did for me is sell some of the gains off from Bank of America
and my top performers, and reinvest that money into some of the new stocks that I added, as well as ones that I don't
have the right allocations. So basically, I started off with this position in
Bank of America of $5400. Actually, it was in September
of 2020 when I bought this. So it wasn't even that long ago. And that went from like five grand, and then I was obviously investing, I think, a little bit more money here, and it went all the way up
to somewhere around $17,000. So then I rebalanced, and automatically, it sold
off some Bank of America, and then dropped that down to
an allocation of around 9,000. And even then, it's gone up
quite a bit, up to $9700 now. So, that was why I changed
around my portfolio. I didn't add any new money, but rebalancing is kind
of a really cool feature you have available to you, if you're looking to
maybe add some stocks, or change your risk
allocation in your portfolio. However, the most important
thing to understand is that when you rebalance, you are potentially having
a taxable event occur. So, in my case here, it was
a bit of a tough decision of, ""Do I just leave Bank
of America the way it is until it's long-term capital gains, or do I take some profits off the table?"" And because it's had
such a massive run-up, I decided I was gonna rebalance. And I'm not gonna have to
worry about the taxes on that until basically, 2022, but
it wasn't a heck of a lot. I think it was around $4,000 of realized short-term capital
gains when I rebalanced. But I think that's totally worth it to have a better, diversified portfolio across a lot of different stocks, because a number of them in my portfolio, I was concerned were
beginning to overheat. And I actually went ahead
and took a screenshot here when I did the rebalancing,
which was a couple of weeks ago, because I wanted you guys
to see what was sold off and what was largely purchased. So, I ended up selling $32,455.19 worth of stocks, and M1
Finance did this automatically, based on their algorithm,
figuring out how to rebalance. So, here's some of the
stocks that were sold off. Bank of America was the
majority, almost 7300, Caterpillar, Intel, Emerson
Electric, Genuine Parts Company, Microsoft, IBM, National
Grid, Apple, and McDonald's. And in return, I purchased about $27,000 worth of my new stocks, which were Walmart, Texas
Instruments, and Logitech, and added more shares
to Proctor and Gamble and Johnson and Johnson. And personally, based on
what I was seeing happen with Bank of America
and Caterpillar stock, and a lot of these names, how they were going higher
and higher every single day, I felt way more comfortable
moving some of that money into these tech stocks and into Walmart, which all of those had
actually recently sold off. So I was more interested in stocks that were not necessarily
at all-time highs, but were good companies
that recently went on sale. So, just to show you a couple
of the stocks in my portfolio that I was a bit concerned about, obviously, Bank of
America, I purchased this, like I said, around 22
per share in September. So I bought it somewhere
down in here actually, or no, if it was September,
it was back in this area, and again, it shot up like a rocket. So I got concerned, and wanted to take some
money off the table. Same exact story here
with Caterpillar, guys. I got into that one
around the same period, and stocks don't generally move in a straight line like this. I hope the company continues to do well, as we all get back to normal life here and there's more construction, but this is something that concerned me, so that's why I decided to take
some profits off the table. Intel was another one. I purchased this stock after they had a sell-off
earlier this year. And they've had a massive run-up, from like $45, all the way back to 65. I'm not as concerned with Intel, because if you look at
the five-year chart, they're not even back
to their all-time highs, but you can look right here, in the last day alone, this
stock was up almost 5%. So, chip stocks are surging right now. And so, a lot of Intel
gains came off the table, and were reinvested
into those other stocks. And even some of these blue-chip names, like Genuine Parts Company, this was one of the first stocks I bought in the peak of the pandemic. This stock is, again,
back to an all-time high. It was as low as like 58 bucks a share. Now we've doubled that, back to $120. So, that's another stock
I wanted to sell off. And the last one was Emerson Electric. So we'll take a look at that chart now. This one has had one of
the most incredible rallies that I've ever seen with a stock. Again, one of the first stocks that I bought during the pandemic. And I mean, this has
just, was insane here. And a lot of people don't even know what Emerson Electric is. This is a big blue-chip
dividend aristocrat. This isn't even what I
would call a growth stock, and it had incredible performance here. I mean, if you look at the last year, the stock is up over 106%. So, those were the stocks
I was worried about in my portfolio. But that being said, here are
the ones I am excited about that still seem to have room to grow. First of all, IBM. People have been sleeping on this company. It's done not much over
the last five years, but it's had a couple
of good trading sessions in a row here. And if you look at the last
month, it's up around 15%. So, I would love to see
IBM getting more traction. And this could be a great leader in my portfolio for the next month. Similar story here with 3M. This was, I believe the
first stock I bought in this portfolio. And it has never really done much for me, but over the last month,
it's up around 11.3%. And if you look at the five-year chart, this stock used to trade at 250 a share. So, there could be a lot of
room for this company to go up, and it's on a nice trend here so far, that started back, almost a year ago. So 3M, obviously sold
off during the pandemic. Not probably as much as everyone else, due to the medical
aspect of their business, but because they were
supplying medical masks, I think they were seen
as a bit of a hedge, but there's clearly still potentially room to go here for 3M. And then another stock on my list that I'm excited about here is McDonald's. If we look at the five-year
chart, while they are up, they've been in a bit of a
period of consolidation here. And if we look at the last year, you can see they were up as high as 227, and then they began to slide. So they are consolidating right now, and I would love to see 'em move higher after that period of consolidation. So, I would expect to potentially
see McDonald's do well. And then as far as the new
stocks I added to my portfolio, Walmart, for me, was a no-brainer. They've traded as high as
somewhere around 150, 152 a share, and they went back all the way down to around 125 or somewhere. So, for me, that was a no-brainer to add Walmart to my portfolio. Logitech as well has done exceptional over the last five years. And then they ran into a bit of a hiccup, but they've been doing pretty good over the most recent span of time here, going from 90 bucks a
share back up to 100. So I am still down a
little bit on this stock, but I expect it to do
well in the long run. And then Texas Instruments,
unbelievable day it had, up 5.44% on Friday. But if we look at the
five-year chart here, again, they had a bit of a hiccup, but they're right back
up to all-time highs. So, super excited about this new addition to my portfolio as well. So, that being said, guys, the
last thing I want to do here is cover the overall
holdings of my portfolio. And my cost basis here
did go up a little bit because I rebalanced my portfolio, but I didn't actually add
any new money to this. Based on that new cost basis, from some short-term capital gains, the gain from this portfolio is 21.32%, or around 33.5k. We'll go ahead and sort this
by the largest unrealized gain. Lowe's, again, that's another
stock I forgot to bring up that I'm concerned about. It's just done so well at all-time highs. So some of the gains from
Lowe's came off the table. Emerson Electric, up 84%, about 85. Bank of America is up 62.
Caterpillar, I'm up 55%. Genuine Parts Company, 55, give or take. Apple, I'm up about 37. Intel, about 26. Microsoft, 23 1/2. 3M is up about 21%. Coca-Cola, up 17.7. McDonald's is up around 14.
IBM is up around 11 1/2. Like I said, I hope that
one continues to do well. Johnson and Johnson is up about 8 1/2%. National Grid, my former employer, that utility stock is up around seven. Texas Instruments, up around 6 1/2. Walmart, a newer purchase
here, up around 3%. Proctor and Gamble is up only 2%. Merck is a little bit, 1% down, so, pretty close to break even. Verizon, I'm down about 2%. And then Logitech, I'm down about 3 1/2. So, right now, I'm super
happy with this, guys. You typically have a lot more
red ones in your portfolio, but I've been pretty good
here, I guess, strategically, with when I'm purchasing these stocks. So, I'm sure I'm gonna have some stocks that don't do well in the long run, but I'll continue to update you
guys here every single month in this format of video. Also, guys, if you're curious how I built this portfolio from scratch, I have a completely free training video that walks you through, step-by-step, how I built this dividend stock portfolio. That's gonna be the very
top link down below, if you guys want to check that out. But anyways, guys, thank
you so much for tuning in. Hopefully we might see, I don't know, we could see $200,000
portfolio next month, just from market gains. Like I said, I don't really
plan on adding any new money to this portfolio this year, because I have other
areas I want to add to, not so much my dividend stocks, because I want to put more money into different types of
investments to further diversify. But we'll keep on updating you guys here. I hope you enjoyed this. If you're new, make sure you subscribe and hit that bell for notifications. Leave me a comment with what
you think of this portfolio. And then of course, be sure to check out that three-hour stock
market for beginners video. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys, and I will catch you in the next one.","['Instructor', 'How', 's', 'it', 'going', 'today', 'guys', 'Welcome', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'channel', 'Hope', 'you', 're',

'position', 'in', 'Bank', 'of', 'America', 'of', '5400', 'Actually', 'it', 'was', 'in', 'September', 'of', '2020', 'when', 'I', 'bought', 'this', 'So', 'it', 'wasn', 't', 'even', 'that', 'long', 'ago', 'And', 'that', 'went', 'from', 'like', 'five', 'grand', 'and', 'then', 'I', 'was', 'obviously', 'investing', 'I', 'think', 'a', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'money', 'here', 'and', 'it', 'went', 'all', 'the', 'way', 'up', 'to', 'somewhere', 'around', '17', '000', 'So', 'then', 'I', 'rebalanced', 'and', 'automatically', 'it', 'sold', 'off', 'some', 'Bank', 'of', 'America', 'and', 'then', 'dropped', 'that', 'down', 'to', 'an', 'allocation', 'of', 'around', '9', '000', 'And', 'even', 'then', 'it', 's', 'gone', 'up', 'quite', 'a', 'bit', 'up', 'to', '9700', 'now', 'So', 'that', 'was', 'why', 'I', 'changed', 'around', 'my', 'portfolio', 'I', 'didn', 't', 'add', 'any', 'new', 'money', 'but', 'rebalancing', 'is', 'kind', 'of', 'a', 'really', 'cool', 'feature', 'you', 'have',

10,YWHSwYPKTCo," Let's talk some trading 101, and when you should not buy a stock. I see this all the time. I'm always on guard. And really, I'm not quite
sure this is a 101 topic. Maybe it's a little bit more advanced, but it is something that
is basic to the success of really any long-term
trading or investing strategy. So I suppose that's
probably why I'm throwing it in the 101 category here because it's such a foundational piece, and it's something that's
easy to get overlooked. And I mean, so much so
that it never really dawned on me per se, to even talk
about it until I got a comment. And then reading the comment, I was like, ""Wait a second. I see what that person's
at risk of doing."" And it also brings about a point
where there's a clear flag, or it's not clear, but it's a warning sign that's like, ""Hey, don't buy yet."" It's kind of hiding in plain sight. So let me read this comment first to set up the context here. And this comes on a YouTube video, or one of them I did about indicators. So Greg says, ""Would you say
to use these indicators more or less if you're on the
fence about buying a stock?"" So let me just walk through
a couple things here about the purpose of
when you have a strategy, when you have a system, whatever you want to call it. This part of the strategy. So you have these bullet points, and then you have this and
that part of the strategy. And this is, we'll just
call them your rules, right? You have rules of a strategy. You have criteria of a strategy. And hopefully, I'm saying the obvious, but that's what's actually
a rules-based system, a rules-based strategies is you need to have certain criteria. You need to see certain things happen. And you need to have a bunch of things that are gonna actually
meet, quote-unquote, the criteria for that strategy. And the reason why that is good, the reason why that is powerful is it can actually put
you into this situation where Greg was at, which we'll call be on the fence. Meaning, you're looking at a stock, you're looking at a cryptocurrency, you're looking at a future, you know, a futures contract,
you're looking at anything. And you're like, ""You
know, I'm on the fence."" What is that telling you? It doesn't meet your rules. It doesn't meet your criteria because if it did, you would not be on the fence. You'd be like, ""Hey, let's go."" Boom, boom, boom, boom, take action. But if you're kind of tiptoeing, you're on the fence
about it, you're unsure. Well, then, you should
not be buying a stock. You should not be shorting a stock. You should not be doing anything at all. That is your cue to see you later. See you later, go. This stock, I'll just use that,
is not meeting my strategy. Because how's it not meeting my strategy? Well, it's not fitting the criteria. It'll cause me to break rules that I have. So if I'm on the fence,
I need to just move on. And I get it. Okay. ""Well, no kidding, Clay. If you're not sure, you
shouldn't buy a stock."" But that's not what most people do. That's not what I do sometimes. What is this person looking to do? Their solution is well, If you're on the fence, then they want, they're asking about what? Maybe other indicators, right? Would you use these other indicators in those situations where you are unsure? But what is that actually doing? What is this part of the
sequence actually doing? That's what we would call foreseeing. You were on the edge of forcing a trade. You're on the edge of doing something that you shouldn't be doing. Why shouldn't you be doing it? Well because you're on the fence about it. And why would you be
on the fence about it? Well because it doesn't
actually meet the rules and criteria of your original strategy. But now all of a sudden, you're out there kind of, I don't know. Let me see if there's anything else out there that can get me off the fence. Let me see if there's anything out there that can just clear things. You don't need anything cleared up. You already have clarity. You know you're on the fence. No more clarity needed. Now, if you don't actually have faith, if you don't actually a
true rules-based system and a true strategy, well then, that's a much different discussion. But assuming you do have a strategy, assuming you do have proper rules, and proper structure with criteria, well, then you don't
need any more clarity. You already got your clarity in the step where you're
saying, I'm on the fence. I'm unsure. But it can be very tempting to go and keep digging and digging and try to basically force a round peg through a square hole. And that's what Greg's
kind of alluding to here. And to Greg, if you're watching this, ""Hey man, if you can
identify being on the fence about something great,
just move on from it. You don't need any other indicators. You don't need anything of anything to try to clear things up because you already have that clarity. So be very careful of that because that's a big problem
out there, forcing trades. I mean, have you ever done that before? Have you ever been there? Where you take a trade and you're like, ""I kind of forced that one. That one is actually not, and why did I even get into that? Well, because I,"" and then
you list off something. They were like, but why did
I, since when do I do that? Like I said, I'm always
battling against that because as traders,
well, we want to trade. So the tendency is,
well, let's try to look for anything that will help us. And that will kind of
encourage us to make the trade, even if we know it's not quite there. Even if we're admitting
that we're on the fence, yet we're still potentially being drawn into doing something that
we should not be doing. So just keep that in mind,
if you're on the fence about something that's when
you know, do not buy the stock. You should not be buying
in that situation. You should not be taking any action, and you should not be then looking for other indicators
or anything like that. You should be trusting your strategy. So that is definitely when you don't want to be buying a stock, anytime you're on the fence. Because you know what? There's like thousands of
other stocks out there. There's thousands of
other financial assets out there that you can go and find something where
you're not on the fence, where you do a full confidence in it. So just go find yourself
one of those situations. Don't put yourself in a scenario where you're trying to fit a square peg through a round hole because in most situations, it's just gonna lead to headache. It's gonna lead to confusion. It's gonna lead to inconsistency. You know, all of the things that we don't want to have as traders. So hopefully, this helped. And hopefully, if you can relate to this, it's kind of one of
those light bulb moments where like, ""Oh yeah, I've
been kind of wasting my time trying to get myself off the fence when I should just totally move on to a totally another trade. So like I said, is that if
you have any other suggestions or questions regarding this, leave those down in the
comment section below. Like I said, this whole entire video was inspired by a comment. So I mean, that's why
I do read all comments. I will reply to all comments because they do, they're good for ideas to kind of throw these
sorts of videos together. So hopefully, you find it helpful. And then also check out
the channel as a whole. There's a good variety of videos. And hopefully, you like
what you see enough to hit that subscribe button. But if you liked this video, please let me know in the comment section, please hit that like button. I really appreciate it. Thanks for watching. First off, thanks so much for
watching the entire video. Real quick, before you go, I wanna invite you to a live webinar, web class, training,
workshop, online event, whatever you wanna call it, but it will be me, live, revealing to you what I've discovered that has
allowed me to transform myself from being an employee
to being my own boss. Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total. I'm going to cover three
keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency
within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way. The second key is super awesome because it, quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use. But in a cruel way, this becomes
a pitfall for many traders. I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the
pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key when you hear it, sounds way too good to
be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works. Then at the end, I open it up for a question and answer session that is, again, totally live. Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up
as it will be recorded, and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you. Click the image on the screen or click the link down
in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note, is limited due to the fact
this truly is a live event. If you have any questions, let me know. If not, I'll be seeing you soon.","['Let', 's', 'talk', 'some', 'trading', '101', 'and', 'when', 'you', 'should', 'not', 'buy', 'a', 'stock', 'I', 'see', 'this', 'all', 'the', 'time', 'I', 'm',

KEN MAHONEY, KICKING IT OFF WITH YOU, WHAT’S YOUR TAKE IN TERMS OF ALLOCATING CAPITAL IN THE MARKET GIVEN WHAT’S GOING ON WITH TECH? A HUGE RUN-UP AND REAL ROLL-OVER IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, DO YOU STILL WANT TO BE A SELLER OF BIG TECH? >> SO WE ARE EQUAL -- WE ARE IN THE STAY AT HOME ECONOMY FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN THAT KIND OF LONG TECHNOLOGY TRADE OVERWEIGHING. BUT IF YOU NOTICE NOT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, YOU HAVE TO GO TO NOVEMBER WHEN PFIZER CAME OUT WITH A VACCINATION AND WEEK LATER MODERNA AND YOU SAW MONEY SHIFTING TO OTHER INDUSTRIES WHICH IS POSITIVE. HOW LONG DO YOU HIDE OUT IN THE STAY HOME ECONOMY AND TECHNOLOGY? IT IS NICE TO SEE IT’S BROADENING OUT. ONE HAND THAT WE ARE SEEING, 1 TRILLION-DOLLAR UNPAID FOR STIMULUS PLAN OR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT AND HOW YOU PAY FOR TAXES. I’M GETTING CALLS FROM CPA’S TALKING PROFITS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT DOES SO WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIGHER CAPITAL GAINS. IF WE GET MORE TALK ABOUT HIGHER CAPITAL GAINS TAX, WE GO FROM EQUAL WAY TECHNOLOGY TO UNDERWEIGHT TECHNOLOGY. MARIA: SO YOU DO THINK THAT THE IDEA OF TAXES GOING HIGHER WILL DAMPEN WHAT HAS BEEN A VERY STRONG STOCK MARKET. I AGREE WITH YOU. THAT’S WHAT I’VE BEEN SAYING. IF YOU TAKE THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO 20% TO CLOSE TO 40%, OBVIOUSLY WE WILL SEE PEOPLE WANT TO GET OUT OF THEIR PORTFOLIO IN ’21 AS OPPOSED TO ’22. >> GAME OVER. WE WERE COUNTING ON THE MODERATE DEMOCRATS TO KIND OF HAVE SOME COMMON SENSE HERE BUT THERE’S NO COMMON SENSE IT SEEMS. LOOK, THEY’RE RUNNING AND RACING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY MAY GET WHOOPED IN MIDTERM LIKE OBAMA DID. GET THINGS DONE NOW SO THEY ARE RUNNING FAST AND HEAVY. I CALL IT TWO ACT PLAY. HIGHER TAXES AND QUITE FRANKLY THE DIMENSION WILL LAST 3 TO 5 MONTHS. I DIDN’T THINK 3 DAYS WE WOULD GO FROM 1.9 INFRASTRUCTURE TO 3 TRILLION -- I’M SORRY, 1.9 STIMULUS TO 3 TRILLION-DOLLAR, YOU KNOW, INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO TAKE MONTHS.

12,kNZHJQiNbvc," Oh boy what a day! Hi traders! Thank you for joining. I'm about to show 
you my best day ever. I've been trading for 21   years and I've never had a day like that that's all 
thanks to GME; now take a look at what happened   to GME. This stock started today at $260  
and look at the way it's just moving up that's the   first few minutes of the trading session. I got 
prepared for this trade. I knew pre-market time  that something big is going to happen to GME, well 
actually I thought I knew that for the past three   days and it did not happen, so I'm still waiting 
and today I came up with a plan which was a very,   very extreme plan. I was planning on a one million 
dollar trade and I knew that I'm risking one   million dollars. Now take a look at the daily of 
GME to understand why I'm doing that. This stock   was at $19 just recently moved up over $450 just 
yesterday and the way it started today with a big   move up after a big gap down - that indicates just 
one thing; there still is short sellers who are   being squeezed out of this stock and this has to be 
stopped sometime and I'm about to take advantage   of that. So I'm planning a trade in GME and I did 
announce in my trading room today that    I have a target which is around $200 and I'm 
expecting the stock to come down, I did not expect   it to come down today. I did say that it's gonna 
take probably a few days, maybe two or three days,   I didn't know how long, but this time I'm going 
to hang on and just you know take the heat. Now   take a look at the point where I started 
selling that's the point where I'm about   to short 4,000 shares right now because it moved 
down from the highs, well I was wrong. I did   have a stop loss my stop-loss was not a technical 
stop-loss because I stopped trusting GME recently.   I stopped trusting the technicals in GME recently 
because I just learned from the past few days that   well it's a short squeeze it doesn't have to work 
according to the known technical rules now look at   this point I'm down two hundred thousand dollars 
and remember my stop is one million dollars, which   is approximately half of what I earned last year. 
Now four hundred dollars down,   five hundred thousand dollars down and that was it. 
Now GME started to come down you're seeing   it being halted several times that's one of 
them because when stock is coming down a lot   it's being halted it's being stopped now it 
resumes and it starts trending lower now it's   getting to be a little bit more clear. Now I'm 
understanding that that would probably be it   and at that point right now it crashed I missed 
that point really because I wanted to add right   there under $400, in fact Scott in the trading room, 
he just shorted it at $400 now it pops up again   and I'm getting ready to add another 2,000 shares 
because I like the trend right now. It looks to me   like it's failing now it's hard to see because 
it's a fast forward here but you need to take a   look at the buyers and the sellers to understand 
why I thought there will be a pressure now I'm   about to add another 2,000 shares and look at the 
way it just comes down now very nice technical   formation here fall short and at that point,  
again halted, so I will wait again until it resumes   here it goes again it resumes. Added two thousand 
shares. Now traders if you like this video so far   how about giving us a thumb up it's right here 
that button it helps our channel helps more people   like you who are interested in trading so we will 
really appreciate that. Now let's take a look at    what continues to happen here today in GME now I 
just want to remind you, my target was around $200,   $250, but that was not an intraday target. I knew 
I'm getting into this trade for several days.    I was surprised. I was surprised. Now here it is being 
halted again. Now at that point it's quite clear   to understand that the stock is coming down, look 
at what happens right when it opened; just moved in,   halted again and again when it's going to open you're 
going see a lot of sellers coming in and look at   how it goes I'm up four hundred thousand dollars, 
five hundred thousand dollars and again it's being   halted as you can see here several times as it 
came down now look at the way it just crashes down   and that's the time where really it's starting to go 
back to its senses. Another crash right over here   and at that point again halted. Look at the results 
here I'm up 1.2 million dollars. Taking my profits   right here. Moved out of the trade. You see the 
price is around $140 I was really planning for $200.   In fact, I was saying to myself that if it only 
comes down to 250 dollars intraday I would   take it. Now take a look at the results over here 
I had several trades today that's not my only   trade but definitely my best trade ever up 1.278 
million dollars. Well, I've never had the trade like   that and I hope you enjoyed this trade and if 
you'd like to see more of my videos you do   have the subscribe button right over here and you

13,QM-0z5BDIQE, hi chicken gang and friends i'm super pumped for this video that's why i'm standing up so are you confused on what's happening on gme stock and you want a summary of it i've been getting quite a lot of requests so in this video i will talk about why the retail investors are pissed how they come together and how all of this is going to play out at the end anyway i appreciate an early thumbs up for the lgo and supporting my course thank you so much so hedge funds had always had this unfair advantage they control the media they get in the trades before us and leaving the retail investors stopping all the losses and for all the corrections they cause jobs and homes the people have lost for all the people who can't afford a decent freaking life while wall street gets rich and for all the times they got bailout with tax money so this story is not about money it's about sending a message is about everyday people coming together fighting the big boys do you remember tesla stopped before the run up many retail investors were fighting the fud back in 2016 before my youtube days i was actively speaking on stage about tesla well this donkey melvin capital has been shooting tesla since 2016 and this is sweet donkey revenge i'll link their trades below we retail investors are sick of the big boys the hedge funds burning retail investors tremendous and elon musk has joined the fight with us some of xiaomi stocks like virgin galactic is highly shorted with 30 short float elon musk is also joining the fight tesla almost went poof because of the short sellers pushing the stock price down back in the early days 2016 2017 this is the sweetest revenge now elon is in a better place tesla is a much better place the story couldn't get better by the way my next video will be on tesla i'm going to do something crazy to my portfolio and something that i'll talk i'll never do so stay tuned so the story told in about one minute a few months ago wall street bets had about two million followers i think now three million someone on wall street bets noticed that a hedge fund had taken a massive shock position against gamestop gme was shorted 130 percent and this means for every 100 shares there is 130 shares that need to be bought back like how is this possible adding to that they noticed gme had a good cash position jeremy could easily like buy back all their shares and burn the shots so a bunch of redditors on wall street bets convinced everyone on the track to join forces and buy as much game stock stock as possible this made several hedge funds lost billions of dollars melbourne capital that donkey that shorted tesla had to borrow money to cover their shots else they will go into bankruptcy the act of covering a short position is buying the stock so this caused gme to shoot out further to this infinite uphill climb the hedge fund is now in [ __ ] so redditors are still now searching for other hedge funds to burn the big boys are now screaming is illegal but hey they really lost their own gay man so how all of this is gonna end game stop will eventually come back to fair value not the four dollar stock but probably if you apply a pretty lousy pe to or price to book ratio you'll bring the stock back up to maybe 20 30 fundamentally gamestop business model is not relevant my real worry is actually robin hood blowing up it is a slight chance and in running multiple businesses this was what i learned if it's an operational problem it can be fixed but if it's a reputation problem good luck fixing it is going to take years and in those years the business may go up in flames like all crashes it starts from one entity falling causing this domino effect i suggest robin hood investors to move their money out to cash app i hope this whole gme saga will not be the starting point of the next crash anyway wrapping up from the start i pump a little money in to send a message and ready to lose it all if you are in this for the profit you are in the wrong place we thought 2021 couldn't be more dramatic for the past few days the internet blew up and it came together cnbc's coverage on this whole saga is almost 24 hours it's everywhere on twitch on fox news i haven't been entertained for such a long time the story of david versus goliath has always been my thing you see from what i do now like always giving real good information free no money involved so i'm never biased you may appreciate the thumbs up i hope i summarize all this well and as always invest safe you,"['hi', 'chicken', 'gang', 'and', 'friends', 'i',

14,LTssDfXRGvY," Good morning, it's Clay at claytrader.com. This will be a live trade video where I try to capture my
trades as they play out live. Real quick, before I get
started, before the market opens, when I say live, what I mean
is that this is not a situation where everything has been recorded and now I'm coming back
and talking about it or doing a voiceover, some
sort of post-commentary. I'm recording myself,
seeing the information for the very first time. So if you want raw
thoughts, raw reactions, raw emotions, you will get that. If you want a nicely edited
video, nicely scripted video, you're not gonna get that here, but if you want a nitty gritty
look into what it's like to be a day trader, how
day trading can play out, then yeah, you're definitely
gonna find that here. So think I'm gonna watch GME
out of the opening gates. Yes, I am actually gonna watch it. Coming to life here a little bit. There are actually shares available to short now on this one, which is what that green
E on my screen represents. So the markets are now officially open. And we'll see what it wants to do, although U was just going
pretty bonkers right before. Yeah. So I'm gonna watch this one actually. Looks good. Although you can't do
anything with it right now when it's going straight down. I mean, that would be totally chasing. So we'll see how this
thing wants to play out. Tesla, what is that? Okay, Tesla already made. GME is still just dropping. Yeah, I think U. That one's definitely catching. I don't even know, 128 as a test. Can I even do five? That's weird. Oh, symbol. No, I typed it on the wrong thing. No wonder why. All right, well, not just
kind of a whole lot of, or GME actually does look interesting at the $70 mark, but... Nah, not as good as what
I thought it was looking. All right, I am gonna go
ahead and pause for now. All right, watching 126 here. As a potential area to get short. If it wants to come back
down, but as of right now, it's going the total opposite direction. So maybe that's not even
gonna come into play here. Oh, if you do hear typing, that's just me making alerts
over in my live chat room. So if you're not familiar, I
do offer a community there. So that's what you hear. You're not, MVIS, you're
not hearing things. Maybe 66 is a... potential area to short here on GME. Although I definitely
do want to see this one play out a little bit more. So all right, I'm gonna go ahead. Wow, and look at U now go
the total opposite direction. What's going on with DKNG here? Oh, wow. Let me get that alerted. Wow, what a gap and trap. To think that there were some people that bought up there on that gap. Hopefully they're not still holding. Brutal. All right, I'm gonna go ahead and pause. GME down at 66, which
I talked about earlier. I think I talked about it too. I can't remember, but I did make an alert in the chat room right
here as a flush point. But I don't want to take it right now, but if this thing can at
least start to go sideways, sideways, and then head back down, I would find that very interesting, especially now that it's
bounced off it again. So yeah, 66 has now become
that much more interesting. So I'm gonna keep a close eye on that and we'll see if that level
can come back into play again. Like I said, I don't want to take it on this particular candle here. Probably not even the next one. Want to see it goes
sideways here a little bit. So even on this candle,
I'm not willing to take it. That might cost me the trade. That might mean that I get left behind, but I'd like, just like I said, a little bit more confirmation. But not on this candle,
but if on the next candle, it looks like it wants
to break down through 66, then I will take that trade,
but we'll see what happens. And again, this is not prerecorded, so I don't know what's gonna happen. Maybe that trade will
never come into play. Maybe I'm not gonna get left in its dust. I don't know, but that's
just my mindset right now and what I want to see. So I'll go ahead and pause. Okay, watching actually 66.25. That's the area that seems to be more so that confirmation point. But I'm also watching the five minute. So I want to see this candle
stay above it too, actually. But next candle, I will like
it extremely, extremely much. So hopefully this candle
can stay up above it. But I think if 66.25 goes, it's got a good chance of pushing down. But like I said, I don't want
to take it on this candle. So I'm gonna go ahead and pause. All right, the next candle has started. It's gone green, so I
love it that much more. 66.25 will be the level that
I'll be watching closely. You can see right there, 66.25
update on the flush point, But definitely wanted confirmation, 'cause right to be fair, maybe this is some sort of bottoming and this thing's getting
ready to head back up. That's always a possibility too, but we'll see what happens. And just like that. Wow. That's why you got away for confirmation. So as of now, looking like a 66.25 is, attractive as it was, is now out of play. I mean, it could come back into play, but now looking like I'll
probably do some looking around. All right, wow. That fast it came back down to 66.25. And has once again bounced off that level. So failed, bounce up. Do not want to take it
on this candle though. No way. No way. And I don't care if it
costs me or not, but... Do not feel comfortable at all taking it on this particular candle. But yeah, I mean, there is definitely a line in the sand being
drawn here right around 66.25. So I will go ahead and pause again, but. Now I'm gonna keep it going on this. It seems though 66.30 is more so that key area. And I missed it. Can I get some on the back test? Got some on the back test. Let's see if we can get that
push down through, there we go. All out there for a quick $300. Excellent. Well, the patience paid off. Had to wait and wait and
wait and stalk that thing. But you know what? Sometimes patience pays. So very happy. Oh, wow. Tesla almost same thing. Let's go check out Tesla. Wow, deja vu, 868. Oh wow, yep. 868. And to explain GME, I originally
missed the entry point, but I left it out there. The price came back up to me, filled me, and then came back down. But yeah, took a while and I realized, sometimes with the recording
it can get a little annoying. Come on, come on. But like I said, that's
I guess the downside is I could do a highlight reel where you don't have to sit
through those, but again, that's kind of the goal
here is to just give you a realistic look, and sometimes
that's how it's gonna be. You're gonna be like,
okay, it's looking close. Nope, didn't happen. Okay, looking close. Nope, didn't happen. Oh, okay. Well, now it's really bouncing. Now it's probably not gonna happen. Then all of a sudden, oh wow. It's back into play. Okay, finally happened. I mean, like I said, it can be annoying, but that's how it goes. Although for full transparency
sake, I did pick the wrong, the wrong strategy. I picked a scalp, whereas
if I would've let it work for me more, I mean, now it's $2 down below, maybe even more. So those members that selected a different management strategy, again, I alerted the price level, but at that point, it's up
to members to figure out how exactly they want to
manage the trade themselves. So for those that decided to play it as a, no, I want to hold for more. Hey, they chose right. I chose wrong. But that's the nice thing about trading is you can be partially right. And I was partially right. And that was still enough
to put $300 in my pocket after what was it? An eight-second trade? Yeah, eight seconds. So right there, 427 or 9:42:27, 9:42:35. So right there, eight
seconds and then $300. But yes, in hindsight could
have, should have been more. I just chose the wrong
exit strategy for it. So congratulations to members that chose. Oh wow, MRNA. Has that one been alerted? That one's really just grinding. I might just call it good. It's 9:45, 15 minutes, one trade $300. I'm not sure many places in the market where you can make $300 in 15 minutes. But again, Tesla. Fast mover. So what I'm gonna do is just do. Just gonna do 50 shares. 868. Yeah, just 50 shares here. Oh my God (laughs). Okay, well, that just
was not gonna happen. Even with hot keys. Wow, I'm glad I caught
it on video, but nope. that didn't happen. Well, and again, just to
show how the community works, Tesla. Well, I originally made the alert up here. Flush point, one minute. A lot of time went by because
it looked like that level was not gonna happen and then
made another alert right there that it's back into play. But wow! You all saw that movie, or
saw that movie, saw that move. That just happened way too fast. So I mean, for people that
maybe were speculating more, not actually waiting for the confirmation, they would have been in. So that's a good example of how sometimes when you don't wait for confirmation, that's actually the best way to go, because I mean, by
waiting for confirmation, which is what I was doing,
didn't even have a chance. And that was a crazy move. Wow, that was fast! And all caught on video. Maybe that's the cue that
I should just be done. Maybe that was, Clay, listen man. Just go. You got your $300. It's 15 minutes in. But still watching, still
watching around, but all right, well I'm glad at least
caught that in video. 'Cause again, the power
of charts right there. 868, you saw when it was broken. Wow, it dropped down basically
$4 in a matter of 10 seconds. All right, I'll. No, you know what? So to explain things to those
of you that are maybe new, I do what is called the
be-done-in-30 approach. Meaning I'm looking to be on average done every morning after 30 minutes. So yeah, some mornings it'll take a little longer than 30 minutes, but a morning like this, I
mean, it's been 15 minutes. So I'm well below the 30-minute mark. Because I just do
trading as a side hustle, I do this as just a way
to make some extra money. And for me, I do this because I don't need a private jet or a yacht. Now, if you want a yacht, if you want to pop bottles of Cristal or whatever the cool drink is these days, maybe I'm revealing my age
with the Cristal comment, but that that's cool. Go for it. Like, I want you to get
whatever your goals are, but me, father of four
young kids, one on the way, I just want freedom of time. So for me, if I can pull
in $300 in 15 minutes, to me as a side hustle, that's fantastic. I'm more than happy with that. So from the be done in 30 approach, I'm just gonna call it good. And you know, we'll
call it a victory here. And I realize only one trade, but a lot of actually good
lessons with that trade because there was, sometimes
that's how it goes. You have to stalk and stalk and stalk, and then it'll finally work out. But it can be a little
annoying along the way. And then of course,
Tesla, as you saw there, stalked it, but just
all of a sudden, boom. Moved way too fast, and that happens also. But for those of you that do
enjoy these live trade videos, before I go, one final request
on my part, if you like them, please communicate that to me by hitting the like
button, leaving a comment. And I say that because these videos are not the easiest to make. Because they are live,
I have to talk to you. I have to think about
what I'm gonna say to you. I have to think for myself. What do I see? I have to make alerts to the community. So there's a lot going on. And these videos are possible,
they're totally doable, but they're kind of a hassle. But I will keep putting up with
the hassle as long as I know that there's interest
and that you enjoy them. So if you do enjoy them,
if it is worth my time, hit the like button and
then a simple comment, and the comment can be a thumbs up emoji. It can be a sunshine emoji. It can be any emoji you want, but those two things go a long
way in communicating to me that these videos are worth my time and worth the hassle of doing. So please do that. And then also check out
the channel as a whole. There's a lot of good variety there. And if you're interested
in joining the community that I offer,
claytrader.com/team, T-E-A-M. Again, claytrader.com/team. And you can learn more about
the service and the membership and how all that works at that link. But again, if you enjoy
the live trade videos and you want me to keep making them, hit that like button,
leave a simple comment, even it's just a thumbs up emoji and that'll help me out quite a bit. So thanks for hanging out
and everybody take care. First off, thanks so much for
watching the entire video. Real quick, before you go, I want to invite you to a
live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call
it, but it will be me, live, revealing to you
what I've discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee
to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total. I'm gonna cover three keys that have helped me unlock
profitable consistency within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way. The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is
wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use. But in a cruel way, this becomes
a pitfall for many traders. I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the
pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key, when you hear it sounds way too good to
be true, but it's not. And I'll show you how it all works. Then at the end, I open it up for a question and answer session that is, again, totally live. Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up
as it will be recorded. And you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you. Click the image on the screen or click the link down
in the description box so you can get the date and
time and claim your spot, which I should note is
limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event. If you have any questions, let me know. If not, I'll be seeing you soon.","['Good', 'morning', 'it', 's', 'Clay', 'at', 'claytrader', 'com', 'This', 'will', 'be', 'a', 'live', 'trade', 'video', 'where', 'I', 'try', 'to', 'capture', 'my',

16,Flb9PyndpKk," WallStreetBets, Reddit,
GameStop, short squeezes, AMC. So much drama, but you know what? We now have some data and
it's very interesting data, and it's data that I agree with and I think actually is
telling the true story. Full disclosure on my part,
I got a lot of this wrong, I went down and I, and I don't even know if the
media knew what was going on, but I did go down the route of oh it's the little guy versus the big guy, and it's, wow the little guy is really, you know, sticking it to the big guy. And it's not looking like
that's what actually happened. Now, did the little guy play a role in it? Absolutely, I'm not refuting that, but the data is suggesting that, yeah, I don't know if it was as big as a role as what it was made out
to be, and in my opinion, the little guy, you
know, the retail trader definitely knocked over that first domino, kind of lift that first little match. But then as the data suggests,
yeah, there is a lot of other dynamics at play here, and we also have more data
that is just confirming this. So as of the recording
of this, it's Monday, and this will come out on a Wednesday. So but we've got a
couple more days of data and I kind of like this because
maybe this will come out and you'll be able to say, ""Clay, ""look what's happened to
GameStop since Monday, ""since you did this
video, you got it wrong."" And you know what? So be it, I like it. I liked being held accountable and we'll have to see
what happens with it. But like I said, when you look at the data from what (indistinct) go
through in this article that you see on your screen, and then I go over what's
happened with GameStop over the past couple of days, I think it does a good job of illustrating just across the board,
what's been going on with a lot of these stocks. So right here you can see,
and this is CNBC so it's, I guess I didn't, this is coming from CNBC here. But as you see here,
GameStop mania may not have been the retail trader
rebellion it was perceived to be data shows. So what is data? Well the first bit that
I found interesting was a look at the top 10 most purchased stocks by retail traders during
the market mania last month is missing one key stop or
one key stock, GameStop. So literally, the 10 most
purchased stocks is GameStop. Now I'm gonna stop
right there, ""Well Clay, ""that's because Robinhood
and a lot of other brokers ""restricted it."" And you're not wrong, and to be fair, this article addresses that. However, a lot of this data is
coming from before Robinhood and other brokers ever actually
restricted buying on it. But I think if we're both
being intellectually honest with ourselves, that
that is kind of strange. Top 10 most purchased stocks and GameStop wasn't even one of them. Of retail stocks that is. Like I said, I don't
know, to me that seems that doesn't quite add up,
that doesn't quite make sense. So you can see right here they go over you know the 10 stocks most bought by wait, that was a poor choice of colors. But right here, you can see
the 10 stocks most bought by retail investors in
January, and you got you know, the typical names. You got, you know, the
Tesla's and the Apple. Of course, I mean, P-L-U-G, that thing's been a classic forever. Verizon, Coca-Cola. Again, if I'm being intellectually honest, I would not have guessed
those ones would have been on the list. I can see General Motors with the EV stuff they've been announcing and
then of course, there's AMC. So that would make sense. But, you know, GameStop
was not on this list. So then, as it goes on,
the prevailing narrative was that a band of Reddit-inspired
small traders rose up against Wall Street by
buying GameStop en masse, forcing a short squeeze by
professional hedge fund managers who were forced to cover the negative bets or risk catastrophic losses. But several signs are pointing
to institutional investors as big drivers of the wild
price action on the way up. And let me set up a little
context and just throw a book recommendation out there, and whether you like the guy or not, Jim Cramer, ""Confessions of a
Street Addict"" fantastic book, really good book, I've read
the thing like three times. In fact, I'll put a link down below if you want to go check it out. But in that book, and maybe you've never
even heard of Jim Cramer, Jim Cramer, former hedge fund manager. But in the book, he talks
about how hedge funds, I mean, they are out for blood, they are out to crush one another and if they smell blood in the water, they will go and try to
crush that other firm. Why? How does it benefit them
to crush another firm? Well crushing another firm, crushing another hedge fund
means that those people that invested into that hedge fund are going to have negative returns, and they're gonna be like, ""Well, this hedge fund
manager is terrible, ""they're losing my money. ""I want my money back
so that I can go put it ""someplace else. ""Ah, well, what hedge fund
has been having good returns?"" Well, when you're crushing
other hedge funds, that's gonna make your
returns look even better. So, ""Oh you know what, I'm
gonna go with that hedge fund."" Right? This is not rocket science
on why a hedge fund would be motivated to go out there and crush another hedge fund. And like I said, if you read that book, there's all sorts of stories in it, and one of those stories
is and he explains how if hedge funds know that
certain things are going on from the short side,
and that they can cause some sort of squeeze,
cause some sort of pain, then they will try to do that. So that's why I said at
the beginning of the video, in my mind, yeah, retail
probably played a role in just getting that
first domino to go over but then as the data, as you're
about to see here suggests, it was more so that other
hedge funds that came piling in that ultimately created
that big short squeeze. And again, I'm going to
end this showing kind of what retail has been
apparently trying to do and has failed miserably at it twice now. But so like I said, hedge funds, they are out to crush one another
and then you see this data again that first bit we already saw, as far as retail trading,
not even in the top 10. But then you look down here,
and as it goes on to say, although retail buying was
portrayed as the main driver of the extreme price rally
experienced in some stocks, the actual picture may
be much more nuanced. JPMorgan global quantitative
and derivative strategy analyst Peng Cheng told clients in a note, ""JP Morgan's quant team uses
public data from exchanges ""and applies it to proprietary methodology ""to identify which flows
are from retail traders. ""GameStop was number 15 on the
firm's retail buying list."" Okay, this is coming, I mean, these are like the
geekiest of geeks right? The quants, right? They're there just doing
quantitative I mean, these guys swim in numbers. They sleep with pocket protectors in. I mean, they are the geek upon geeks, and what are they saying? For them was number 15 on the
firm's retail buying list. The rookie investor vigilantes
grabbed the most attention by being all over social
media posting screenshots of their positions and
crucifying Robinhood and other brokers when
the firms were forced to limit trading in the high-flying names. The membership of Reddit
group WallStreetBets has rocketed to 8.5 million subscribers. However, it's possible
the noise from this crowd caused most to overlook Wall
Street co opting this trade to make a fast buck as
well, as the data shows. So down here, you can see that they were actually get this, and this
is what I found fascinating, retail investors were
net sellers of GameStop. Now, last week refers to the week previous when all the big crazy, crazy
price movement was going on. Net sellers. And I will put a link to
the article down below too. So you can go and you can
look at these figures more if you want. But I mean, you look
at this and you can see that the way that the
graph here is set up, there were more people selling than buying from the retail trading perspective, which doesn't make any sense, right? Because the narrative, what I thought, what a lot of other people
around the media thought was, ""Wow, you have all
these retail traders, ""they're all coming
in, they're all buying, ""they're all forcing these
hedge funds to have to buy ""and oh wow, it's just so much buying."" But that's literally not what happened. Net sellers. There was more selling
than buying going on. And I don't say that in a negative way, I say it in a smart way, I'm
actually glad to hear that, that retail traders were like, ""Wow, I'm up a lot of money right now. ""Sell."" Good, I'm happy, I mean, I get it. Once again, the narrative
is diamond hands, right? You have all these Reddit people, ""Diamond hands, diamond hands."" But like a lot in life,
and a lot and not just, I mean it can be politics and anything, a few voices on social media can sure come across as
a whole lot of voices and create this overall narrative that doesn't actually exist,
aka this diamond hands thing. Sorry for all you thinking a lot of people have diamond hands. Net sellers, that's not diamond hands. What is it? I think they call it paper hands, right? So knowing all that, this
makes a whole lot of sense. ""What was going on in the
stocks forced the hedge funds ""to trade to cover ""or they might have been
playing too to win,"" said Piper Sandler
analyst Richard Repetto. And then this is what
I think is happening, especially when you just kind
of understand the business, understand incentives, right? ""Hey, if I crushed that firm, ""I have a potential to get their customers ""and increase my fund."" There always could be the hedge fund that was totally uninvolved, wasn't short, but saw what was going on and said, ""This might be a way that I
can profit just by going long."" Right, and that's what
a lot of people are, hey, buy the squeeze, buy the breakout, buy whatever you want to call it. I mean, it's not like hedge
funds just stood there and watched the entire time. And now this is where things
really start to add up in my mind is, you know,
this retail trading flows dropped off mid GameStop mania. To which, like said, makes a lot of sense. Retail trading volumes were
near record highs at 50% on Tuesday of last week,
again last week being during the week of when
all this was going on, which would make sense, right? Craziness is going on, it's
all supposed to be retail. So yeah, record highs, but dropped off more than 5% the next day, signaling a decrease
in individual investing in what was the thick of the Reddit mania. And that, you wouldn't think,
wait a second, it dropped? It dropped when all this
momentum, all this, you know, little guy sticking it to the
big guy, it actually dropped? ""If this was retail
trading doing everything, ""that percentage would have
stayed the same if not gone up,"" said Repetto. Repetto I think that Repetto, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name. Hedge funds might have
been riding the wave and trying to benefit too. Might have? I think they probably were
trying to ride the wave, especially when you know
that riding the wave is forcing a short squeeze, which
is killing your competition, which are highly leveraged
on the short side. I think that's a fair summary. Now to be fair, trading restrictions by brokers like Robinhood
and Interactive Brokers on certain securities
started Thursday of last week and could have contributed
to the drop in trading that day and last
Friday, to which I agree. But I mean, let's just look at
the trend here, like I said, reached the 50% mark and then next day, and the next several days
continued to drop and drop. Now right here to be fair, again, that you could easily say, and I think it's a valid conclusion, ""Well that's because a lot
of retail got restricted."" So yeah, absolutely. But the point here being,
before this part even happened, the trend was already going down, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense that if retail was just punching
and punching and punching. Like I said, in my mind, and
the way I look at the data, it doesn't seem like
retail was really as strong as what it actually was. I mean, literally, net sellers. You have net sellers, and
combine that with the fact that GameStop wasn't even in
the top 10 retail stocks that were bought. Then you have this where you
have the flow was actually decreasing before the
restrictions even happened. Again, and I'm bummed out about this, but maybe just maybe that the it wasn't as much as the small guys what we were led to believe. And then I also want to point out this because this is the real
world data that I'm seeing that aligns perfectly with this. So what we're looking at here
is the technical chart here from GME, and like I said, I think it illustrates what we were just seeing
and it just matches up. And because again, I really understand and it's a good counter
point is, ""Well, yes Clay, ""of course it appeared that
retail wasn't doing all this ""because of the restriction and all that."" Which again, good point, but also last week,
restrictions started to come off started to come off
and today, restrictions as far as I know, were
totally back to normal. So when restrictions
started to come back off, logic would dictate, alright, retail, let's go. And to be fair, and this is what I think and I talked about this in
a video I did last week, but I think this is very telling. This was Friday morning,
opening 30 minutes, you know, basically the first
time restrictions all done and retail showed up. I firmly believe that this
was retail and kaboom. There it went, opened
up down in the mid 50s, went up as high during
that first 30 minutes to basically 85 and then
started the next 30 minutes got up as high as, let's just call it 95 and then look what happened. Nothing. Everything just fizzled out. And down, down, down it went. And my theory in my mind is
yeah, retail it packed a punch. But it was a very short-lived
punch, no pun intended, and it's not looking like
any hedge funds got involved in this. And because no hedge funds
were getting involved, no big money, no other
outside money was coming in, down it went. I mean that matches up perfectly. I mean, this was in my mind,
and I was thinking on Friday, Hey, you know what, maybe retail is back. Maybe this is going to be
the second round haymaker that is the next talking
point across the markets, and I was really like okay, here we go. It makes sense why this 30 minute candle, it makes sense why Friday
morning was so powerful. Restrictions are gone,
that's no longer an excuse, everybody can buy again. You know, diamond hands,
all that sort of stuff. Let's see what happens, and it lasted for all of about 45 minutes and things just fizzled. And then we look at today, again Monday. Things started off looking good. In fact, the price actually had a gap up meaning for those of you that are new, Friday, the price closed right there, this morning the price opened up there. So that movement right
there is known as a gap up. Again, that's a sign of bullishness, that's a sign of uh-oh, people are buying, people are buying. But then look what happened. What would be known in trading jargon, known as a gap and trap. Market opened up and
just fizzled right out and down it's gone. So it's looking like there
just is not any sort of actual strength, there's not
any sort of follow through through these movements. Once again, I'm putting myself out there, I'm recording, I'm talking
about all this on Monday, it's going to be coming
out on a Wednesday. Who knows, maybe this chart
is going to just go kaboom back to the upside, and I'm
going to be sitting here looking like a moron. Won't be the first time, but like I said, I'm putting it out there and
I'm just giving my thoughts. You don't have to agree with them. But looking at the data and then seeing, you know, the data that
actually matters, right? The real time data in terms of well, what's the price actually doing? And the price made a couple
of bullish movements, Friday, big move up, fizzled,
this morning, Monday, nice move up with the gap
up, totally fizzled back out. So it's looking like the
hedge funds are kind of done with it, the party's happened, all the craziness has happened. They've, you know, some
hedge funds have been crushed or been severely depleted and
now it's just a matter of, ""You know what? ""I think we got some new customers ""because we crushed some
of these other hedge funds. ""Their returns are not looking so good. ""Their investors that put
money into the hedge fund ""are not very happy. ""Mission accomplished, let's
go see what else is out there."" And now it's just left retail all alone and retail all alone. Again, that movement right
there was respectable, but totally fizzled out, and
then that move right there, I mean, it was even worse,
it gapped and trapped. So we'll see what happens
with that moving forward but that that's the
article, that's the data, I don't want to go
through the entire article but I'll put that link down below. And I'm curious your thoughts. I mean, feel free to
leave those down below. Maybe I'm looking at
some bit of data wrong, maybe you disagree, that's cool. That's why I like doing these videos because for the most part,
people are constructive in their criticism, people want to have an honest
intellectual conversation. Some people will just be
like, ""Clay, you're an idiot."" Okay well, thanks, thanks for the constructive
thoughts there, that was very intelligent. But listen, I'm just
throwing it out there. Maybe I'm missing some things. Again, I could be totally wrong. On Wednesday when this comes
out maybe GameStop is at like, $1,000, I don't know, but
from the data I've seen, and from the price action
and how it's behaving, I don't think that's going to happen. I think the game, no pun
intended, is officially over. And I think if anything, retail needs to actually come together, and I talked about this in past videos, I think retail people are they're dividing they're
like out there trying to force squeeze on 15 different stocks. In theory, if all of retail came together and focused on one stock, then I think there could
be some real possibilities. But I think retail traders, they're just spread
across too many stocks, you know, what was it? It was supposed to be GameStop
and AMC and Silver and NAKD and BB, what is that? Blackberry and Bed Bath
and Beyond and SNDL. I mean, there was like
18,000 stocks out there that were supposed to be
the next short squeeze and, you know, it's just and again, it's all mapping out. I was like okay, well yeah. You look at all the data
and then you factor in that everybody's just kind
of spreading themselves thin. And unfortunately, I'm not quite sure that the whole little guy narrative punching it to the big guy narrative was as true as what it is made out to be. I hope I'm wrong, I hope it actually was but you know, seeing this data and then seeing the price
movement of GameStop, it's just not looking
like retail was maybe as strong as what everybody
was led to believe, especially again, when you go to during all the the mayhem,
retail was net sellers. There was more sellers
than buyers going on. That's crazy, I would never have thought that would have been
the statistic and data, but it is what it is. So (indistinct) let me know
your thoughts down below, I appreciate it. And also, if you enjoy these
videos where I kind of take articles or just current
events and talk about it and give you my thoughts, let me know in the comments section or just hit the like button, that's the easy way to
communicate that to me. If I know that there are interests in more of these current event
videos, I'll keep doing them. But if not, then I'll just kind of go back to the normal videos. But I want to at least
experiment a little bit and see your thoughts on that. So definitely let me know down in the comments section below, and yeah, thanks for hanging out. First off, thanks so much for
watching the entire video. Real quick before you go, I want to invite you to a
live webinar, web class, training, workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I've discovered that has
allowed me to transform myself from being an employee
to being my own boss, including how I had only one
losing day out of 73 days in total. I'm going to cover three
keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency
within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way. The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired
into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use. But in a cruel way, this becomes
a pitfall for many traders. I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the
pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way too good to
be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works. Then at the end, I open it up for a question and answer
session that is, again, totally live. Even if you can't make the live session please still sign up
as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you. Click the image on the screen or click the link down
in the description box so you can get the date and
time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this
truly is a live event. If you have any questions, let me know, if not, I'll be seeing you soon.","['WallStreetBets', 'Reddit', 'GameStop', 'short', 'squeezes', 'AMC', 'So', 'much', 'drama', 'but', 'you', 'know', 'what',

18,RAAYOEDPKOw," [MUSIC PLAYING] JOEY MOCK: Hi. I'm Joey Mock, one of
this year's Housestaff Council of Hope residents and a
fellow in hematology/oncology. We're glad you're here. Why? It means that you're
interested in one of our residency or fellowship
programs here at UVA. But before we tell you
just how wonderful we are, we need to talk
about something else. What do you picture
when you hear the names, the University of
Virginia, or Charlottesville? Perhaps you think
of Thomas Jefferson in the rotunda, or
the historic lawn, or a beautiful college town
in the Blue Ridge Mountains. But you might picture
something else. You may envision a university
built by enslaved laborers, one that resisted desegregation. Or more recently,
you may remember a torch-lit rally led
by White Supremacists and violent protests. Either way, you'd be right. In 2017, the past and present
injustices in our community were made apparent
to all in images that were sent around the world. This began a
conversation in UVA, and has led to concrete steps
in GME and the institution to more fully realize the vision
of liberty and justice for all. And in doing so, we've become
an even better place to train. [MUSIC PLAYING] ROBIN ULEP: Hi, everyone. My name is Robin Ulep, and I'm
a fourth year neurology resident and this year's chair of
the House Staff Council for Diversity and Inclusion. For almost 100 years, UVA
has trained physicians to be specialists
and subspecialists. We are more than
820 persons strong, and our 120 training programs
take place in state of the art clinical environments. And we not only train physicians
to be the best in what they do, our teams of residents
include dentists, pharmacists, chaplains, and many others. We also have more than
1,000 dedicated faculty who have chosen to
work at UVA so they can help you, the next
generation of doctors, to become your very best. All our residents
and fellows learn to take the lead, to
take care of patients from all around the world,
and even right next door, in order to give the best care
and advanced care possible. COURTNEY LATTIMORE:
I'm Courtney Lattimore, and I'm a third year
general surgery resident and also the current
House [iNAUDIBLE] Council co-president for this year. We have all worked incredibly
hard over the past few years to create an institution
where everyone of different races, religion,
sexual orientation, and gender feel welcome here. UVA and our nation still
have a lot of work to do, and we invite you to
join us to do that work. Charlottesville is a
wonderful place to live. If you enjoy the arts, sporting
events, the great outdoors, or even incredible restaurants,
then this is the place for you. This year, you have an
incredibly important decision to make about the next
chapter in your life, without ever having set foot
in our hospital or in our city. I chose UVA because
I knew that it would make me a great
surgeon, teacher, and leader. I hope that you will learn more
about our training programs so that you can see for yourself
why all of us chose UVA. At the University of Virginia,
we are confident in our future. And we want you to
be a part of it.","['MUSIC', 'PLAYING', 'JOEY', 'MOCK', 'Hi', 'I', 'm', 'Joey', 'Mock', 'one', 'of', 'this', 'year', 's', 'Housestaff', 'Council', 'of', 'Hope', 'residents', 'and', 'a', 'fellow', 'in', 'hematology', 'oncology', 'We', 're', 'glad', 'you', 're', 'here', 'Why', 'It', 'means', 'that', 'you', 're', 'interested', 'in', 'one', 'of', 'our', 'residency', 'or', 'fellowship', 'programs', 'here', 'at', 'UVA', 'But', 'before', 'we', 'tell', 'you', 'just', 'how', 'wonderful', 'we', 'are', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'talk', 'about', 'something', 'else', 'What', 'do', 'you', 'picture', 'when', 'you', 'hear', 'the', 'names', 'the', 'University', 'of', 'Virginia', 'or', 'Charlottesville', 'Perhaps', 'you', 'think', 'of', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'in', 'the', 'rotunda', 'or', 'the', 'historic', 'lawn', 'or', 'a', 'beautiful', 'college', 'town', 'in', 'the', 'Blue', 'Ridge', 'Mountains', 'But', 'you', 'might', 'picture', 'something', 'else', 'You', 'may', 'envision', 'a', 'university', 'built', 'by', 'enslaved', 'laborers', 'one', 'that', 'resisted', 'desegregation', 'Or', 'more', 'recently', 'you', 'may', 'remember', 'a', 'torch', 'lit', 'rally', 'led', 'by', 'White', 'Supremacists', 'and', 'violent', 'protests', 'Either', 'way', 'you', 'd', 'be', 'right', 'In', '2017', 'the', 'past', 'and', 'present', 'injustices', 'in', 'our', 'community', 'were', 'made', 'apparent', 'to', 'all', 'in', 'images', 'that', 'were', 'sent', 'around', 'the', 'world', 'This', 'began', 'a', 'conversation', 'in', 'UVA', 'and', 'has', 'led', 'to', 'concrete', 'steps', 'in', 'GME', 'and', 'the', 'institution', 'to', 'more', 'fully', 'realize', 'the', 'vision', 'of', 'liberty', 'and', 'justice', 'for', 'all', 'And', 'in', 'doing', 'so', 'we', 've', 'become', 'an', 'even', 'better', 'place', 'to', 'train', 'MUSIC', 'PLAYING', 'ROBIN', 'ULEP', 'Hi', 'everyone', 'My', 'name', 'is', 'Robin', 'Ulep', 'and', 'I', 'm', 'a', 'fourth', 'year', 'neurology', 'resident', 'and', 'this', 'year', 's', 'chair', 'of', 'the', 'House', 'Staff', 'Council', 'for', 'Diversity', 'and', 'Inclusion', 'For', 'almost', '100', 'years', 'UVA', 'has', 'trained', 'physicians', 'to', 'be', 'specialists', 'and', 'subspecialists', 'We', 'are', 'more', 'than', '820', 'persons', 'strong', 'and', 'our', '120', 'training', 'programs', 'take', 'place', 'in', 'state', 'of', 'the', 'art', 'clinical', 'environments', 'And', 'we', 'not', 'only', 'train', 'physicians', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'best', 'in', 'what', 'they', 'do', 'our', 'teams', 'of', 'residents', 'include', 'dentists', 'pharmacists', 'chaplains', 'and', 'many', 'others', 'We', 'also', 'have', 'more', 'than', '1', '000', 'dedicated', 'faculty', 'who', 'have', 'chosen', 'to', 'work', 'at', 'UVA', 'so', 'they', 'can', 'help', 'you', 'the', 'next', 'generation', 'of', 'doctors', 'to', 'become', 'your', 'very', 'best', 'All', 'our', 'residents', 'and', 'fellows', 'learn', 'to', 'take', 'the', 'lead', 'to', 'take', 'care', 'of', 'patients', 'from', 'all', 'around', 'the', 'world', 'and', 'even', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'give', 'the', 'best', 'care', 'and', 'advanced', 'care', 'possible', 'COURTNEY', 'LATTIMORE', 'I', 'm', 'Courtney', 'Lattimore', 'and', 'I', 'm', 'a', 'third', 'year', 'general', 'surgery', 'resident', 'and', 'also', 'the', 'current', 'House', 'iNAUDIBLE', 'Council', 'co', 'president', 'for', 'this', 'year', 'We', 'have', 'all', 'worked', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'over', 'the', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'to', 'create', 'an', 'institution', 'where', 'everyone', 'of', 'different', 'races', 'religion', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'and', 'gender', 'feel', 'welcome', 'here', 'UVA', 'and', 'our', 'nation', 'still', 'have', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'work', 'to', 'do', 'and', 'we', 'invite', 'you', 'to', 'join', 'us', 'to', 'do', 'that', 'work', 'Charlottesville', 'is', 'a', 'wonderful', 'place', 'to', 'live', 'If', 'you', 'enjoy', 'the', 'arts', 'sporting', 'events', 'the', 'great', 'outdoors', 'or', 'even', 'incredible', 'restaurants', 'then', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'place', 'for', 'you', 'This', 'year', 'you', 'have', 'an', 'incredibly', 'important', 'decision', 'to', 'make', 'about', 'the', 'next', 'chapter', 'in', 'your', 'life', 'without', 'ever', 'having', 'set', 'foot', 'in', 'our', 'hospital', 'or', 'in', 'our', 'city', 'I', 'chose', 'UVA', 'because', 'I', 'knew', 'that', 'it', 'would', 'make', 'me', 'a', 'great', 'surgeon', 'teacher', 'and', 'leader', 'I', 'hope', 'that', 'you', 'will', 'learn', 'more', 'about', 'our', 'training', 'programs', 'so', 'that', 'you', 'can', 'see', 'for', 'yourself', 'why', 'all', 'of', 'us', 'chose', 'UVA', 'At', 'the', 'University', 'of', 'Virginia', 'we', 'are', 'confident', 'in', 'our', 'future', 'And', 'we', 'want', 'you', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'part', 'of', 'it']"
19,r6O8pmf03ro, comment yes or no if you think i should sell this uh ap this iced out ap and i should put it into cardano should put it into ethereum to put it into the cryptocurrency markets or or comment yes if i should put it into some stone cold steve austin t-shirts from amazon should i just get a bulk order of these guys what do you think i don't know 100 pure battle snake venom in the veins that's what you've got to have in these markets because if you don't have that in these markets you're going to get wiped out you're going gonna get cleaned out we got a video right here with mark cuban on twitch that we're gonna play talking about cryptocurrencies guys we also got the charts for cardano right here we got the charts of ethereum and one thing that is happening right now that you're going to want to pay attention to this is a massive warning for the entire markets for those you that are holding any cryptocurrency whatsoever what is about to happen to ethereum and what is about to happen to cardano will blow your mind and we're getting into uh gold as well too and we're talking about con cardano's consolidation prior to their smart contract update and what is about to take place if we're looking on coinmarketcap.com there's over 9100 cryptocurrencies they keep getting added lots of lots of crap coins keep getting added every single day and lots of great coins getting added every single day and we cover them on this channel so comment 777 if you're feeling blessed comment comment yes if you're feeling bullish tap the like button tap the subscribe button you know we appreciate you the algorithm does as well too give it a taparoo sink the putt do it for shooter mcgavin do it for stone cold steve because we're going camping on the beaches of the moon let's run the video who's that oh that's the run guys make sure you like comment and subscribe and share it if you fly rank up now what's going up bull runners nick here with runguys.com and we're gonna kick this video off with a giveaway we're giving away a hundred dollars and all you have to do to enter in to win is like and subscribe to the channel drop a comment below every single comment that you leave enters you in to win and then head on over to run guys.com to join our newsletter because on the newsletter we're gonna announce the winner every single week with that being said let's run the markets all right so let's get right into it if we're looking at cardano right now it's sitting at a dollar and 21 cents and it's pushing upwards of this channel right now it's on the lower part of it as you can see this upward trending resistance that is taking place with this black dotted line it needs to hold this support in a dollar and 12 cents if it breaks below that it will drop to 97 cents but if it pushes above a dollar and 35 cents then a dollar and 46 cents that is massively bullish news because what is happening right now with ethereum ethereum broke its all-time high in ethereum's in price discovery mode ethereum may come back down to re-test the all-time high before breaking to the upside because we are still in a bull market if you look at the chart can't you see how similar ethereum is right now to what's taking place with cardano so for those you that want to know what cryptocurrency would make the most sense to hold right now or to purchase this is not financial advice this is not investing advice our channel is strictly for information education entertainment purposes only but you might want to give ada a little look ski uh and and maybe get some bags hold on to some bags and just put them over your shoulder on one of those get a little stick and get a little like apron and just wrap up some ada and just kind of hold it on your shoulder and jump on the train because we're taking the choo choo train all the way the moon guys why because what's taking place right now in the news if we're looking at cardano right now cardinal ada could see volatility as it approaches an upgrade that will add support for the smart contracts and cardone made headlines after ioh case ceo and founder charles hoskinson revealed a roadmap for the blockchain's alonzo upgrade the upgrade will add support for smart contracts and applications however ada's price has failed to reveal to react to the positive news so the news isn't affecting it right now because ethereum is getting the shine bitcoins getting in the shine but just wait for the wall of money that's about to come into this project ada has ada has remained stagnant since it rose to a new high of a dollar and fifty cents in february of 27th of february since then ada has been mostly contained between the dollar support and the dollar and 46 cents resistance this market behavior led to the formation of a parallel channel on the four hour chart that you can see right here on the video each time the ada has risen to the channel's upper trend line a rejection has occurred that push the price of the cryptocurrency to its lower edge from this point the price tends to rebound off the bottom or the top of the channel an ada's price could rise or fall we're going to discuss both scenarios on what could take place and although parallel channels may offer excellent opportunities to profit given the price actions predictability these patterns fail to indicate which direction the trend will take experienced traders tend to wait for a clear break outside of the channels before entering the trade so here's what you're going to watch for pay close attention to this right now because two price targets emerge by measuring the channel's width and adding it to the potential breakout points now cardano will likely rise to two dollars in 10 cents two dollars and 10 cents if bullish investors go through the dollar and 46 cents resistance level that you can see right here where this black dotted line is right now on the screen that you can watch right here however a spike in selling pressure that pushes ada below one dollar could trigger a sell-off towards 71 cents and due to the two possible outcomes you know some people like well where where actually going to go it is imperative to wait for a decisive four hour candlestick close outside of the channel before entering any trade to avoid potential risks so what you're going to do is you're going to want to go to charts.cointrader.pro so charts charts.cointrader.pro and you can type in in the search bar ada right here to be able to watch this for yourself you type it in uh ada to usd it trades against different pairs you want to make sure it's cardano to the usd us dollar and then you look click right here where it says d um and you trade it to four hours you change it to four hours okay and i'll show that right here and you can watch that on what's taking place right now guys and uh you could be able to see where the price is going to go you can mark up the charts yourself you can learn how to use these little tools right here on the left-hand side for yourself and uh that'll be able to help you out with uh your trading as you become you go from a beginner you know in the cryptocurrency industry to an experienced degenerate just like the rest of us so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna play uh mark cuban's little video right here and hear what he has to say about um bitcoin and ethereum because i think it's really interesting to know what's happening with those two because bitcoin is the big brother ethereum's the little brother and then um all these other cryptocurrencies are just the degenerates that are hopping on the the families the families bandwagon to see what's happening people are saying ethereum is king and people are also saying that ada is the ethereum killer so what do you guys think is going to happen over the next few months with ada do you think it's going to overtake ethereum is that possible so a couple things where people got mad at me where i i was at odds with the bitcoin community is i never saw it as a currency i saw it as a store of value digital gold right and just a supply and demand issue and obviously you know the algorithmic scarcity is built just to define supply and the more demand you can build for it the the higher the price is going to go and that's not a bad thing but it was never really designed to be a currency and you saw that in 2017 with all the forks and all the arguments about block size and everything and so i i was fine with it as a store value and um really just to me it was just a question of when it started becoming more more commonplace for people to buy it because that's what was going to lead to a significant increase in price and that's what happened um and then with ethereum i really you know with the ico blow up and the ico you know balloon it was interesting and i actually lost some money at that time um just experimenting with some things but nothing horrible and but i learned some there but it really wasn't until this summer when smart contracts really started to evolve and become more more available that things really took off and that's you know like i said before that's where i dug in and to me in terms of how it all plays out bitcoin's great as a platform and it's it's accepted now it's an alternative asset it's going to replace gold in the portfolios of a lot of people and that hopefully will push the price up as long as the whales continue to huddle but that that's a different type of platform and this utility really only happens when you wrap it at least as of now i've thought that the replace gold concept has really started to click because you start to ask people if you're under 30 or if you're under 40 you say hey you want a ounce of gold or the equivalent in bitcoin the answer is pretty obvious for most people so there's this generational effect what do you actually think is a realistic timeline for that to occur like do you think it's a market cycle thing so like this market cycle maybe it can get to 25 percent of gold or do you think it's just going to be all at once at some point and all of a sudden it's gonna be gradual so you're starting to see these etfs pop up and ways for people to buy it and so you know it's too difficult still to get money into a wallet just to buy bitcoin so you need to have somebody that you can work with that is going to hold it for you right because most people are going to be terrified of having you know that bitcoin in their own custody you know and so until that's so gold people are going to want to buy it through traditional means through their broker or robin hood even you know coinbase to a lesser extent but just just that process of going through the know your customer aml stuff and and connecting to your bank is still too much of a hassle right now i mean people are it's just easier for people to deal with the stock brokerage um but as there's more and more opportunity for people to buy from the people they already have their savings with and their retirements with then that's you're going to see a chip away at gold because the reality is gold has sold off a narrative just like bitcoin is you know and it's really built on trust do you trust gold or do you trust bitcoin and like you said younger generations you know are going to trust gold i mean i'm going to charge bitcoin rather because gold a utility in and of itself yeah that's so true guys and i mean ultimately if we look at the the chart of gold right now you see this green arrow that's when the cares act came out and the stimulus checks first started going into uh american citizens hands where'd that money go into well it went into the price of gold uh it went into the cryptocurrency industry it went into the hands of the wealthy investors and every single person out there you know that pays rent that pays for food that buys clothes that pays for their cell phone bill that buys gasoline for their car they have to give that money to the owners of those companies and the owners of those companies are the wealthy investors so every time the stimulus money anytime money is put in the economy it'll all end up back in the hands of those who understand how money works and where do they put their money will they put it into the market so what he's talking about with uh with gold and with bitcoin you know the younger generation now is putting their money into into bitcoin the older generation you know sees gold uh has seen gold as a you know legit store of value over the past i don't know like 3 000 years right because cryptocurrency is an experimental money program but what's about to happen right now with bitcoin that's going to affect the entire altcoin market cap is when bitcoin grows the altcoins follow it shortly after you know if bitcoin matches gold's current market cap right now um as more money gets put in the economy bitcoin would be at like 500 000 or something like that because a gold's market cap is over 10 over 10 if we look right now bitcoin is at 1 trillion dollars but gold is well over 10 right now so if bitcoin were to 10x that'd be 590 000 and what's happening right now on twitter most of you guys know peter schiff you know uh he's always been negative about uh bitcoin but on april 1st he posted i was wrong about bitcoin and clearly it was an april fool's joke he said since his tweet didn't specify what about bitcoin he got wrong it wasn't really a prank he didn't think the bubble would get this big or that so many otherwise smart people would be foolish enough to buy it so he was wrong about that but right about everything else but what's interesting is this whole planet is made up we're living on like a jumanji planet or the sims or the matrix or whatever you want to call it so why would people even hold gold anyways you know it's not doing anything for them you know what are you gonna have a gold bar and you're gonna melt it and turn it into what you know like a plate for your kitchen what's the use case of it ultimately the use case of silver you know is a lot more functional tantalums a lot more functional things that are used in consumer electronics are a lot more functional so gold has just been like god's money you know gold and silver has been god's money so with cardano if you're looking at cardano what's the use case of cardano what's the use case of ethereum it's still too early to really tell guys because this world right now it's not really ready for cryptocurrencies just yet until um you know advancements in technology take place over the next 50 to 100 years so we're still super super early as a civilization but those of you that have been around for a while you know what's happened over the past just 20 years with technology you know i was born i was born in the 90s i'm a 90s baby but those of you that are born like the 60s 70s and 80s you've seen these phones go from like little verizon flip phones to what they are today the cameras on them have better technology than 30 000 cameras in the 70s that were used to film blockbuster films so as technology advances expect these cryptocurrencies to advance right now we're living in miami florida and the mayor is turning the city into a crypto city you know the arena the american airlines arena they're gonna have the airplane stripped from the top and the arena is gonna be renamed for a cryptocurrency company that i think is paying like the city two million dollars a year or something like that so it is absolutely wild how much money and how many millionaires and billionaires are going to be created over the next few months than any other industry on the planet but you got to know what to look for guys so there is one project in the decentralized finance sector of uh this industry that we found that when we started talking about it well when we saw it it was 250 dollars right now it's over 700 dollars in february it was at two dollars so this project is already like 360 like x percent growth or something like that 360x it's absolutely insane how much it's grown and uh on runguys.com we've uh put it on there to learn about our number one way to make passive income online staking and uh ethereum is a proof of stake blockchain compared to bitcoin's proof of work and proof of stake is where it's at right now if you really want to know how to make profits in the cryptocurrency industry i'll tell you what guys we've made millions and this is the most powerful way to be able to do it and uh you know it doesn't make this doesn't make you uh or maybe like smarter than anyone else you just gotta know where the trends are right so on runguys.com i'll leave the link in the description below we have a video there that's about i think it's like 26 minutes long so hide your kids hide your wife go in a room where it's quiet watch this video pay close attention to this page because we break down the steps for you on how to get this project and where it's going to go and experts are saying that this project right here could be over ten thousand dollars within the next two years it's sitting at seven hundred dollars right now the market capitalization of it is a fraction of what bitcoin is the max supply is a fraction it's 4.3 million it's a fraction what bitcoin is and bitcoin's max supply and why is this important to you okay i know i'm talking fast here but bitcoins circulating supply versus max supply it's 18.6 million is the circulating the max supply is 21 million so based on simple economics you probably took an economics class in school when the supply is low usually demand is higher and that increases the potential upside for price right so when there's some scarcity that means people want it more regardless of whether it's fugazi for gazi or you can even use it you can't hold the bitcoin right but you can make profits from it if you bought it low and you're holding it right now 59 000 and uh you know you sell for usd or whatever you want to do but with this project right here the max supply is 4.3 million 4.3 million compared to 21 million so where do you think it could go based on the community when the community really starts sharing it because there's a few different ways to earn okay i just want to explain this in simple uh simple terms for you guys because that's the way my mind works i'm kind of a simpleton sometimes because you don't got to be smart to make money you don't got to know you know these fancy terms of like what is proof of stake what is proof of work what even is the blockchain it doesn't matter whether you know it or not what matters is what you buy how long you hold it for and when you sell it right so right now this project based on the liquidity in the market capitalization when it grows you earn just from the growth of the project just like every other cryptocurrency the number two you earn by staking okay when you stake it away and you lock it away in the protocol on the link in the description below and you lock it away on the community builder section you earn up to four percent per week per week barring the fact that the liquidity keeps rising the market cap keeps rising and that percentage will be based on how many people are purchasing the product purely and right now i mean it's pretty insane i think this week you know we're we're doing like eight percent which is wild but it's not going to be that much forever it'll be between three and four percent per week and um that percentage you know as it grows in the community grows we'll also increase the the price of the cryptocurrency as well too because right now it's a 750 dollars when we made this video is it like 540 or 580 so there's lots of profits being made people are jumping on board they're getting their metamask setup set up and if anything you guys gain out of this video it's this right here to get a metamask mark cuban what he was talking about i was uh you know people that don't want to hold their cryptocurrencies themselves purchase like etfs and uh those etfs are you know who knows what they're going to do but for you you want to be able to hold your cryptocurrencies in your meta mask and your meta mask is where you have control of that it's like your own bank that you can use to swap cryptocurrencies on these other exchanges like uniswap like one inch and uh that's step number one so you you guys want to get that set up regardless of whether you want to you know get started with this project or not and then step number two is uh you're gonna be buying ethereum first and foremost and you're gonna be sending it to your metamask wallet because ethereum is what you're gonna use to swap in and out of uh different altcoins like nft projects and uh decentralized finance projects and uh this project to be able to stake it as well too step number three you're gonna connect it to the metamask wallet which is super simple you're gonna connect your metamask to the community builder section and uh we walk you guys through that in the video in the description below and number four is you're gonna stake your ethereum or you can stake usdc which is you a us dollar coin it's a staple coin for an rgy and it swaps it to energy and then once you stake it you're earning up to four percent per week and step number five is the third way to earn where you can share your community link to earn 25 rewards in energy so if you know any like influencers if you know people that are excited about cryptocurrency that want to purchase through your link it's very similar to how you would share like your amazon associates link maybe you bought a tesla and you got a tesla you know you share the your affiliate link for that you get rewarded there maybe you're like a partner with american express and you share that maybe you created a weeble account and you share that maybe you get started with airbnb and you share your link for that these fortune 50 companies understand the power of affiliate marketing and that doesn't make it too good to be true that just makes it work is what it makes it do does right and it's too good not to do essentially in my mind so you know we staked away 96 000 of our own income uh because we believe in it that much we're not just like shilling this thing and just pushing it out there because we don't believe in it no we put away 96 grand of our own income into it when it was like 500 now it's in at 700 and we're earning interest every single week and that passive income we then can live off that passive income for life for life it's like a 401k that doesn't go away wealthy people understand guys if you look at the chart of gold right now why do you think gold is rising so much because wealthy people would rather put their money to something that's going to work for them because they realize they're not they can't work forever that's why you retire right because warren buffett said it best he said if you don't find a way to make money while you sleep you will work for money until the day that you die and if you have to work for money congratulations you're a slave to money you got to get your money to work for you and go out there and make you more money and the best way to do that is to put it into assets that are going to spit out more money for you and cryptocurrencies that industry is so powerful guys you know gone are the days where you just buy a cryptocurrency in the past and i know it's things are moving so quick but gone are the days where you just buy it and you wait for it to go up and that's where you produce profit this day and age it's all about staking earning interest from that living off that interest or putting that interest back in if you don't need to live off of it if you have other streams of income keep your job keep working your job unless you want to quit it you know you can do that but you need profits to be coming in for yourself and that's what we're going to help you guys do on runguys.com so with that being said i look forward to seeing you on the next video i look forward to seeing you on runguys.com the link in the

20,CA-n1GY88DA, elliot let's cut the crap get down to brass tacks it is clear more than ever that ethereum is bullish in 2021 as we see more people onboarding on the network to defy two nfts and i'm sure we asked you this back in 2020 but now that we're months into this and we have more data points could you give us the bold case for ethereum in 2021 and how you see it playing out at the end of the year uh yeah and thank you for the for that tea up because we have had this conversation a couple of times uh the thing about ethereum is in 2017 this was exactly what was happening which is tons of people were flooding in ethereum was extremely congested and expensive and the narrative that this just simply was going to die out was all inclusive and and everybody uh was believing that the eath killer movement was going to be the future and let me just be clear there will absolutely be other chains collaborative chains other layer ones that have tremendous value and utility like finance smart chain uh like matic polygon like polka dot like uh cardano however the reality is just like what we saw with bitcoin how there were so many coins that were cheaper and faster and better to create and deploy uh a financial mechanism or transfer stores of value the fact is that ethereum has the trust it has the trust of a really really big network and the most important applications and the highest value applications are finding their home on ethereum because it is trustworthy and it is secure so when you're storing for example a video game character well maybe just maybe that should be done on a cheaper chain on a faster chain to improve the user experience but if i'm storing the deed to my house or an insurance policy for my life insurance or maybe a significant access key for a you know a pension fund worth you know billions or trillions of dollars then i would really seek out the absolute highest standard of security and trustworthiness and this is where you see the difference of the slower moving more valuable ecosystems uh long-term versus the faster moving uh more experimental and newer ecosystems that would require maybe higher throughput and so what you'll see is trade-offs uh but ethereum's case for being the absolute undisputed home of very high value important smart contract functions i believe will continue to hold value and for that reason this is the sort of difference between a very broad approach a very broad appeal versus a very deep appeal where the people who are moving huge insanely big hard to comprehend big sums of money are doing it on ethereum and that hundred dollar gas fee means nothing to them whereas the people who are looking for maybe a super clean user friendly experience that would a appeal to the tick-tock generation now maybe that's going to take root on a different chain and most likely it will now what i like about what's happening is that the eth-killer movement has moved to the scalar movement and you're seeing that these chains like polka dot and even cardano now finance smart chain polygon the focus isn't on stealing from eve but it's on offloading from eth and i think that that's going to be a big big characteristic of why 2021 is slightly different than 2017 though based on twitter comments youtube comments it feels as though people are once again writing eth uh as essentially old news and as people who have been through this cycle before i think it's pretty easy to have some perspective on it for those people who are new to it i would just say look there's going to be amazing value in those chains there's going to be amazing value capture across all valuable layer ones there's also going to be insane utility and time-tested battle tested incredible value that comes from ethereum so how would like do you think uh 5 000 eth near the cycle top maybe end of the year ten thousand dollar eth how do you think about it uh well you know it really depends on how far bitcoin goes but if bitcoin reaches the several hundred thousand dollar mark the sort of uh 250 k plus range i think that puts ethereum um at a twenty thousand dollar to fifty thousand dollar price point are you looking at what happened last time uh ethereum topped you know it's just for easy math ethereum topped last time at about a 1440 uh and bitcoin's top before that cycle was at about 11.60 now if bitcoin you know if obviously ethereum has different you know tokenomics they have more more supply um but you know in the end i think ethereum has the gas to go to over 20k uh and if this bull run continues like we think we're going to um and i think there's even a possibility that it makes a sort of pretty astronomical blow off top run uh to something above 50k i've said as high as 87. i mean that number comes from dividing the market cap of gold uh i think you guys covered this as well the market cap of gold uh and sort of giving that to ethereum and saying well is ethereum and what it provides to the world is it as valuable as decentralized gold and i think this was a quote from uh tyler winklevoss which is it has to be at least that value you know a decentralized operating system that's secure and global and and uh and can actually um sort of divorce us from typical systems of finance and power and ownership i think that there's a huge case that over time we could reach uh that system being worth as much as decentralized gold uh and i think that those numbers point to you know some pretty astronomical targets so whether it's this cycle or next or whatever i think heath has plenty of gas to reach a healthy five figures 50 to 80k east you make raul paul look like charlie monger to be fair on this cycle i think 20 uh is where if i had to say hey this is where i would say for sure uh if we have this cycle i think it would hit but you know there things at those stages of the bull run get really parabolic and whether it stays there or not i mean you look at each path to 1400 and then back and you see it was a very very short moment but it did go from just a few hundred bucks up to 1400 and back very fast and i think you could see that where it goes up from maybe 10 000 or 15 000 and then makes this insane explosion up and then right back down again and that's what would be like the blow off top you know long term you know 10 years down the line 20 years down the line i think looking at you know eth being worth you know 50 plus thousand dollars is is something i'm comfortable with saying for sure and in our final eight 12 minutes whatever we have you touched on this a little bit but i want to dig a little deeper what is the future for polka dot and cardano in your eyes in the sense are we just going to watch them compete for market share for the next 5 10 years for ethereum provide infrastructure how do you see it first and foremost competition is fantastic fantastic for for innovation second of all i think what you're going to see and what we need to see is interoperability really explode and take center stage the way the internet works is not a bunch of data silos you have every single data center talks to every other data center and that's how it needs to happen with blockchain if we're going to have really the future of the financial networks that's something that polkadot um with their sort of parachain systems is really pushing forward and obviously cardano has their own approach to interoperability uh what i'd like to see is you know who's the best at interoperating and i think that that will be a big advantage and so that's kind of where i'm looking at differentiators um but cardano doing something better uh and then polka dot or eth or any kind of combination of those words is all bullish for the space right because we have more value creation and more uh essential fundamental toolkits that are being created uh here in the decentralized world so i think people misunderstand uh how you know every coin having some kind of breakout innovation is really good for every other coin uh and that the the need to be tribal and say i like this project and so that project must be bad i think it's it just fundamentally misunderstands the way crypto grows uh look at crypto itself when bitcoin grows so does ethereum when ethereum grows so does all coins and the market caps balloon it's not like they eat away from each other yes great perspective to watch the full conversation there is a link down below in the video description and if you're interested in learning more about cryptocurrency click subscribe you do not

21,mwRyeOqjRMo, the ethiopia deal has been leaked let's get into it [Music] so chris today we're going to be talking about how hoskinson has leaked the cardano ethiopia deal and um as we get into this video guys hopefully you will find it useful informative maybe even entertaining at times if you do hit the like button we both really do appreciate that and of course if you want to stay up to date with all of the technical analysis for the ada price and the cardano news then why not go ahead and subscribe to the channel by subscribing you will be kept up to date with absolutely everything we do here at cheeky cardano it is free and you'll stay well informed so why not right with that being said chris anything else you'd like to add before we jump down to the desktop and get into this yeah just let us know what you think of the the africa deal you know what are your thoughts is it going to impr you know improve the price um are we going to see price discovery um or do you think that it's going to have no bearing on that at all just interested tonight fantastic right let's jump down to the desktop and start talking around what's going on here what did hoskinson leak right then so hoskinson leaks that the car dino ethiopia deal was actually signed by the minister let's get into this right so the cardano community has been eagerly awaiting the final confirmation of the ethiopia deal since early february and this is uh john o'connor director of ef the african operations at iog and revealed that to the time that the company of cardinal uh inventor charles hoskinson was in the final stages of a government contract in ethiopia to bring several million users onto the cardinal blockchain and obviously since then there has been plenty of speculation as well as unforeseen um you know delays and it's good that this is going on in the background sometimes it's good to have those leaks earlier on but sometimes those deals can take a little bit longer than maybe first anticipated and specifically when governments are involved and chris i mean you do a lot with um you know government bodies and regulations and things like that you can testify to just how much pain it is in these delays right yeah it can take an awful lot of time just to get the simplest of things completed it's ridiculous at points and uh you know it's far worse in in parts of africa nick it really is but however um as hoskinson reported last week the deal was now close to being finalized on march 25th a special committee had signed off on the decision to implement the project leaving only ministers of the minister's signature until last and since yesterday the deal may also have mastered this step so this is really interesting even though hoskinson had to hide the announcement uh in a picture puzzle because he signed um an exclusive contract he didn't miss the opportunity to tweet the following lines and following two pictures so here's the here's what it is right so for some reason i have this strong desire to tweet these two pictures uh must be the blending of my hair ornithology on our photographical um endeavors and my love for the 20th to the 18th century american history um so yeah if anyone who's uh into the ornithology there is a picture of an african bird and obviously american history there as well in the writing so i think um yeah it's interesting you know he's kind of been a bit cryptic about it but i think that's an interesting way to announce such a thing the cardano community decoded the picture puzzle if you will and left the image uh the left image which was of uh a white checked to terraco um this is a species of bird um you know from the ethiopian region and on the left image is um or the right image i should say is john hancock an american merchant uh statement and uh basically a patriot of the american revolution and hancock was uh president of congress when the declaration of independence was adopted and signed and so he is uh you know primarily remembered by americans for his large um flamboyant signature on the declaration um so much uh so that uh john hancock became the us and informal i guess it's just about about that signature ultimately but yeah it's good to see that they he's i wouldn't call it a puzzle it's quite basic right you've got an ethiopian bird and you've got obviously the guy um for an american history there just you know he's known for signing so i think yeah it sounds like the final signature has landed all those birds have been coming in so um you know taken together these two things clearly indicate that the minister has signed off on the ethiopia deal meaning that the official announcement of the deal and the africa special could be coming as early as next week so super excited for the um the africa special we've been waiting on that for a long time haven't we chris yeah we have and uh it's gonna be exciting to to finally have that upon us oh yeah hopefully there'll be lots of fantastic new nuggets of information that will come out of that africa special as well i think that's going to be fantastic so watch this space as we uh as we get into all of that good stuff and iog is planning a major expansion as well in africa and which just like the uh ethiopia deal will uh be subject to uh the uh subject of the africa special so no doubt we'll hear more about their expansion plans uh how many headquarters where they'll be and all that kind of good stuff uh obviously with partners such as ice addis and hoskinson wants to gain access to more than 25 countries in africa and expand the iog africa team from dozens to hundreds if not thousands over the next five years so this is going to be absolutely huge and we're going to start seeing some fantastic things happen for the cardinal ecosystem and as we are now moving closer and closer towards alonso uh the gogan era pluto smart contracts all of that good stuff we're gonna start seeing a lot hopefully happen with native assets on the cardinal ecosystem and seeing how there's air dropped out and how we can do lots of really cool things with the ecosystem going forward in terms of smart contracts and obviously having millions of people on boarded onto the cardano ecosystem in the coming sort of months and years that's going to be also a key player to see how the ada price also appreciates this is huge huge news and i think we're going to start seeing significant price discovery for the cardinal ada token and hopefully maybe chris and maybe at a stretch just possibly some of the thud around uh her ghost chain will eventually disappear you never know right we'd live in hope that's it we do hope that that goes for sure okay absolutely so um chris is there anything you want to talk about maybe a brief update on the cardinal staple yeah so it's doing really well um you know i think we've we didn't get like the the best rewards for for this epoch uh we should be finding out later today uh for for the uh lottery uh for the next epoch but you know um we expect the pool to average out at the five and a half percent which we've always kind of said you know we've been fortunate we've done really well uh previously uh long may that continue um but you know we expect to have a few uh weeks where we don't get as many rewards as as other weeks so you know part and parcel of uh you know the cardano stake in ecosystem i guess but um if you're not delegated already it's it's worthwhile delegating your ada um it helps obviously with the decentralization of the project it also supports the channel and you guys get some juicy juicy rewards so everyone's a winner absolutely you gotta love uh so juicy rewards and uh win-win scenarios that's fantastic and so guys hopefully you have found this video useful and informative a bit short and sweet but we wanted to get this out there so you're all kept up to date with what's going on if you have found it useful informative entertaining at

22,vXU74_GHz9c, welcome everyone to hsn also known as houston news today is april the 4th 2021 we're simply here to give you all the heads up as to where price is going to go so that we can ensure that we profit into the market rather than the trap taking our money from us if today is your first time ever viewing our content and you appreciate it hit the like button share the video and also subscribe to the channel this is our main focus of this channel is to ensure that we predict where prices are going to go without being confused so now let's break this down real quick for card download you guys can see right here we did a price prediction into the marketing card donald all the way back since march the 26 2021 and we kept our last price prediction video update we did for cardano on april 1st we kept it we left it alone we didn't mess with it we still expected the marketing card donald to give some strength and you can see the market is not really emphasizing to us a lot of strength rather than us seeing that strength we are still seeing the continuation of selling going on in the market for cardano so if you have not seen the opportunity to take profits into the market in cardano on april the 2nd even on april the 3rd you might have missed out we're going to talk about all that real quick into the marketing card down what we're going to do first i'm not sure if we had our tp price at a dollar 25 in cardone i think we did mention that on the first of april if so we were able to capitalize on that on april the 2nd 2021 five and a half percent right there in the market but what we're going to do now we're going to erase all of this and get rid of it and update you all on where we're expecting the marketing card dollar to go in the future so that we can beat everyone else in the market and profit more than what they can profit from so like i've told you i want to circle this i want to give you all this heads up right here all of this right here all of these days trading simplifies that the market was going through more selling than strength the market was induced with more sellers than there were buyers in this particular time frame we got to recognize that it is what it is and we can see that precisely because the market in cardano could not capitalize off of it and move higher in price now when i switches over to the three-day time frame you guys can still see here that the market in cardano and just simply trading within the range there's not a lot going on into the market in cardano the market has just been simply trading sideways ever since you know the 24th of february 2021 all the way to the current day nothing else has been going on but while we've been seeing the marketing cardinal trade sideways we've been seeing a little bit more indication that the market in cardinal is not overly bullish it's not that strong looking at cardone on the five day time frame i'm still seeing the feeling that the market in cardinal this week right now and there's nothing that you and i can do about it we just simply need to recognize for what it is and make our plans and adjustments accordingly that's what we need to do and looking at this on the three day to five day even here on the weekly time frame we're seeing some emphasis on market weakness right now in cardano now granted i'll tell you the market is not giving us that much weakness it's not overly oppressive to where we would expect the market to completely fall out and completely drop in price but that doesn't mean that the marketing card dollars are buying either what about looking at the marketing card donald on a three week time frame even here on the three weeks time frame the last two three week price bars were still seeing weakness the market in cardano could not see the market closed towards a high of these two three weekly price bars so what does that mean it means that we're losing that interest you know everyone was gung-ho about seeing this marketing car don't shoot high in price and now you kind of can see the market pumping the brakes you can kind of see that the market is not that euphoric as what we've seen right here for instance on this three-week price bar you know we had a very widespread and we was able to close at least up there towards the higher the bar even on this one and another indication that can show us that we're losing that enthusiasm for cardona to go higher in price is the volume we have seen the market volume in cardone do window somewhat on that last completed three week price bar so let's look at this on a monthly time frame and as you all can tell here last month we were not able to see the marketing card donald close above the previous high which lets us know that the market definitely were induced with a lot more sellers okay so let's see this real quick into the market i'm gonna look at this on an hourly time frame to see if we really have a lot of weakness into the market and currently we do you know there's still a lot of weakness here into the market to cardano that restriction area is coming in at 1.25 right there okay let me show it to you so dollar 25 is the current area restriction into the market in cardinal and it's still not weak you know the market one thing right here on this 13 hour price bar right here during this time the market definitely tried to drop in price and they're still buyers here you know don't get it twisted these hourly time frames we're definitely still seeing market buyers coming into the market in cardano even amidst all of this selling even amidst all of the people trying to get out the market in cardano they are still here the demand is literally being revealed on an hourly time frame so now what do you all think the market in cardone is going to do where do you think we're headed because this is simply just a massive trading chain uh trading channel that we've seen going on into the marketing card down that's it which area is going to break first are we going to break 1.16 to the downside first or are we going to break a dollar 24 to the upside first leave me a comment in the comment section and tell me what do you all think the market is going to break first okay so i'm looking at this on the two day time frame still seeing that we can see in the marketing car down here on the two-day time frame so you might see a very small chance and when i say small to my five to ten percent chance to see the marketing card down go higher price but even then i still want to be convinced that it's going to be sustained that it'll be able to last long so what we're going to do on this video we're going to place some weakness into the market all of these time frames that i've shown you is not indicating to us any strength albeit the 13-hour time frame we're seeing some strength right now but i really won't get convinced that the market is going to shoot higher until i see a break above 1.25 on strength and we're not seeing that yet so let's do this real quick into the market for cardone we're going to play the weakness here and we're going to be conservative i'm not going to expect the market in cardone to completely crash but we're just simply going to play a little bit of weakness maybe back down here to a dollar ten with some about seven percent it's not much it's not massive but we can literally see the market trap come in and try to prop cardona on this ascending line okay we can literally see that happen so keep your eyes open on that as we see this marketing card download try to dip a little bit lower in price ultimately i'm gonna bring it all the way down here to a dollar four dollar five which is about 11 almost 12 movement to the downside in that analysis so this is it you guys can understand why we're going to play the weakness in the market for cardona in the next three days we're going to play the weakness we have our initial area of take profit right there around a dollar ten it might be a little bit higher maybe two pennies higher of a dollar ten or maybe two pennies lower but that is the area that's the vicinity of which we will come in and take some profit off the table ultimately back down to around a buck five so now this is what we're seeing now we want to give every one of you all the opportunity to tell us what do you see if you see something totally different it's fine tell us leave us a comment in the comment section and tell us where do you expect the market and cardonal to go in the next three days because either way you need to get prepared you need to make sure that you are in position and that you got a plan to execute once the trap takes the price there questions comments let us know as always make sure you predict you profit and you

23,xtBoP885Zr8, all right ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another video on nate's crypto channel today we're going to be talking about carrardano aida some very important fundamental news not only the fact that it's 100 decentralized and what does it mean we're also going to talk about cardano and ethiopia deal and we're gonna first of all start with some very very important oh you already started talking very important references i'm not gonna play them for you just wanna bring your awareness to them show them to you so you guys can after watch alone but these two videos will say iohk cardano white boy overview with charles hoskin it was almost four years ago and this video imagine something the future i mean look at husky look at him look the future will be decentralized by charles hoskin and tedx talk this was seven years ago almost and we're going to be talking about these videos and why if you're holding cardano if you believe in the project or if you don't really know what cardano is and you just heard someone on youtube from nate's crypto channel or so i don't know talking about it it's a great opportunity these two references will be very important for you to get more insights and to understand what the project really is okay so we're going to be talking about that as well but first in order to increase the engagement of this channel we're giving away a full ether every single month to one of our subscribers yes wonderful ether is given away so if you want to participate in our next ether giveaway which is going to be on may 1st subscribe to this channel hit that notification bell and give this video a thumbs up the winner will be announced on our instagram page the link is in the description and let's get back to the video all right so we're first going to start off with this article talking about that it's 100 decentralized currently what does it mean and then of course we're also going to give a price prediction on aid and look at the technical which i forgot to mention earlier we're going to look at the graph i'm going to be explaining what i think is going to happen in the near term future and i'll give you just a real quick heads up we need for the macd if you see these two lines over here we're going to talk about that in just a minute but once these two cross the bullish sentiment will overlap the bearish sentiment which we have been seeing it happened in xlm stellar in polka dot in trailing but in cardano it still hasn't happened but once it will happen stay tuned we're gonna be talking about it all right so cardano ada is 100 decentralized uh what does it mean so if you're new to crypto decentralized basically means that it's owned by its users and it's not a centralized organization owning it okay so cardano eta is a decentralized uh blockchain and you probably heard that as well so it means that if tomorrow for example if you're using an amazon service or an apple iphone icloud service and tomorrow apple i'm giving you an extreme example just so you can understand tomorrow this centralized organization says you know what mister too bad you can't use our service because blah blah blah then they can do it technically okay now in a decentralized organization or in our case in a decentralized blockchain there's no single organization that can say what's gonna happen okay it's owned by its users and that's why we're seeing by the way a lot of new technologies moving to the to the decentralized uh space we're seeing tether network that's a decentralized uh streaming technology we're going to be talking about that as well we're seeing file coin which is basically a decentralized dropbox i'm just simplifying it right it's taking the idea of storing data in the cloud and just making it decentralized so there's a lot of these very cool very useful decentralized projects currently and cardano being one of them and today cardano announced that it's fully 100 decentralized and here's the thing here's why it's important that i'm talking about why what is the centralization mean what are the how come these different projects that are now turning into um you know decentralization why is a lot of institutions currently uh having interest in this and is this the future well we're first going to start off with this okay so this is a ted talk tedx talk actually by charles hoskinson i mean look at how he changed oh my god husky you gotta teach us you gotta teach us the secret and this was again almost seven years ago he said the future will be decentralized now we already know that charles hoskinson was one of the co-founders of the ethereum blockchain together with gavin wood and together with vitalik buterin aka vidi but in this talk it's incredible to see how ex like how the things that he talked about in this video in this talk how it came to fruition he said the future will be decentralized and he gives a lot of examples of the current problems that were seven years ago also today uh we do have a lot of the similar problems but it's incredible to see you know how he says okay this is problem number eight this is problem number uh b and blocked problem number b problem number one problem number two and how blockchains decentralized blockchains will solve these problems so that's incredible and i highly highly recommend if you're watching this and you're subscribed to this channel then my job is to also bring your awareness into these kinds of things this is an incredible talk that i encourage you to go and watch and to see how many things and how cardinal progressed into becoming one of the leading uh blockchains in the world and what problems exactly is cardano solving so that's number one number two as i started to say in the beginning of the video this is also another important very important video to not just speculate on cardano's price but to also understand if you're looking to hold it and you want to understand what cardano is you got the man himself charles hoskins explaining what exactly is cardinal from his own words so again another important and important video that i highly recommend you to see and that will kind of again give you confidence let you sleep better at night if you hold card on for the long term and not oh my god no no no i don't know i don't know what's gonna happen okay so that's regarding that and we'll finish off with this quote to kind of wrap everything together achieving decentralization of block production is significant not just for cardano but also the wider blockchain industry this is an important step toward full decentralization and living up to the promises of blockchain technology by creating a global system which is truly independent of central authorities pushing power to the edges got it so that's kind of how you wrap everything together 100 decent decentralization by cardano looking to solve the problem of central authorities saying who gets a bank who gets um to hold land for example again i'm saying these examples from the tedx talk that charles hall's going to talk about and you know were a step forward currently with cardano becoming fully decentralized into a world where technology or platforms belong to the users and not to central authorities amazing time to be alive guys amazing time to be alive let's move in now before i share with you my price prediction for cardano aida i want to invite you to join our private inner circle if you want to learn how to trade crypto how to profit from when the market goes up and how to profit from when the market goes down as well so you can get a full training how to trade crypto and also join our private inner circle for market signals to get inside a community where we share very important insights regarding different altcoins different projects you're welcome to join the link is in the description and let's start so we're currently seeing that ada has been pretty stagnated in the past few days trying to create a new rally to the upside but not successful in the past uh week also even with this candle i mean we saw on the 26th of march we saw already reaching almost a dollar and 30 cents with this incredible incredible uh almost 11 daily kennel since then it's kind of you know corrected to the downside it's currently at a dollar and 18 cents and we're underneath the 20-day moving averages you know not that good however here's the thing and here's what i want to bring your awareness and attention to we haven't seen the macd cross and this macd basically what it shows is the current market sentiment so the blue line is the blue bullish sentiment and the orange line is the bearish sentiment so whenever the orange line is above the blue line we that means that there's that the bearish sentiment is stronger than the bullish sentiment and we haven't seen the bullish sentiment stronger than the barrel for the whole month okay for the whole month the sentiment has been bearish and even with the coinbase announcement we can see that there still wasn't a cross between the two sentiments and still there was a touch on it on the 19th of march but still uh the bare sentiment was stronger than the blue one and the last time that there was a cross for the bullish sentiment look what happened okay it was over here on the first of february that was the last time i don't know if you can see this but that was the last time first of february that the sentiment okay here we go was clear it was crossed first of all and the bullish element started creating a gap between it and the bare sentiment and since then we have seen of course a rally a significant and incredible to today's price 240 percent rally in just two months all right so 240 percent increase and to the top to its all-time high 326 okay which is incredible so that's what happened the last time that the two sentiments crossed now am i saying that we're going to see another 300 increase of course no one knows what's going to happen exactly but i can say this from my experience from trading once we will see this cross and the cross will eventually come that the bullish sentiment will be stronger than the bearish cinnamon i do expect cardano to rally significantly and to create not only a new all-time high but we could see a very very strong rally all the way up to the two dollar mark now some of you will listen to this and say it two dollars but that's 80 from here well yeah we've already seen cardona do 80 moves in you know a week a week and a half we also saw if you remember this coinbase announcement even though it didn't sustain itself but it was three days 47 percent increase okay so yes cardano can uh rally 80 percent in a very short time we do need these sentiments to cross the bullish sentiment to be above the bearish sentiment you know can it happen in the next few days in the next week in the next week and a half no one knows when exactly is going to happen but i do expect it to happen in the near term so week two weeks three weeks it should happen as long as bitcoin doesn't uh have a black swan event a certain sell-off bring a lot of fear into the market and we've as i've said we've seen polka dot and chain link and xlm stellar the their sentiment has been also ethereum so the bullish sentiment has um crossed the bare sentiment and all of these cryptocurrencies with card with cardano it still hasn't done that and so i'm expecting as i said just to wrap this video up as long as bitcoin doesn't create a black swan even there's something crazy in the market we see a large sell-off bitcoin stays healthy you can even stagnate at its current price i do expect eventually cardano ada to have this cross between the two sentiments just like we've saw in chain link in ethereum and polkadot the huge rallies that they've had once those cool off i do expect a lot of that profits in that money to move eventually to cardano ada sentiments cross cardano creating a new all-time high and reaching the two dollar mark um once it's not gonna happen overnight guys okay let's be honest but once these two sentiments cross we could see an 80 rally all the way to two dollars and as usual guys let me know in the comment section what do you think currently not only regarding ada but also regarding ethereum polka dot other cryptocurrency projects that you're looking at that you're in but what do you think of ada as well i mean do you think that in the next week two weeks three weeks we can see across in the sentiment we can see cardano reaching a new all-time high two dollars three dollars what is your price prediction for ada during in 2021 or during this bull run i'd love to know what you're currently doing and also finish off with inviting

24,PvlJcUsL-14&pp=qAMBugMGCgJpdBAB, in this video cardano data is showing explosive growth in new users and wallet creation on the cardano blockchain kodano block production goes 100 decentralized which is an incredible feat we have trading analysis of cadano aida and the latest important news and updates for kodano hey everyone welcome back to moneyzg my name is james i make helpful crypto content like trading guides how-to videos and coin updates just like this one every day so if you haven't done already consider subscribing in this video we have many important ada updates including very interesting data about new users new wallets and transactions on the cardano network we also learned about some timelines for possible canaan news this week that could give us some trading opportunities and price moves in the future we're going to get right into the cardano trading analysis but if you haven't done already make sure to pick up your free money with celsius wallet i use

description taking a look at the ada chart right now then over the last couple of weeks we can see a chart pattern called a rising wedge pattern now this happens when the price actually comes into a point into the future so volatility is actually reducing in the ada price so we're not getting a really huge move to the upside we are definitely still in an uptrend though as you can see from this bottom trend line just hitting two major points right here and as you can see from the top the trend lines are moving into a wedge what we can see is volume is way lower than we got during those big moves a few months back so there's really a couple of ways that traders might look at this chart firstly is that a rising wedge pattern along with lower trading volumes sometimes what happens with a rising wedge and falling volume is that it's telling traders that essentially the move is coming to an end and that potentially the move is running out of steam so the volume is coming down and also what is happening is that the price isn't moving up as fast as well this could potentially then see an actual move to the downside although i think with ada what we're seeing really here is just a consolidation which for me is actually quite healthy after these huge moves and it makes a lot of sense because the big news that came has already come and so we're just seeing a slight consolidation in ada as you can see really over the last seven days it's been outperformed by other cryptocurrencies that are really taking the limelight away from ada because ada has had the big news right now we have to look for some other news which i'll definitely be getting onto in this video coming to that new straight away then d equals zero and you can see here cardano achieves block production decentralization one hundred percent of the blocks on cadano are now made by the community and stake pool operators it's a huge milestone for kodano it didn't affect the price in any way shape or form though of course this was probably all priced in already with those big moves we saw earlier there are still elements of kadano that are centralized but in terms of block production it is a big deal that 100 now of the blocks are being produced by the community we can see now that ada has around 2 300 pools with a healthy proportion creating blocks some are controlled by exchanges binance is a big state pool operator for ada so just to keep that in mind i think it's one of the biggest others though are single pool community operators what's really important though is some of these stats for ada and we can look at the daily transactions which is super important and also the daily active staking wallets which you can see huge growth in firstly then we'll come to daily transactions as you can see here this is on adapuls.org and you can see absolutely huge growth in the transactions of ada now just to put that into some context we have binance smart chain here definitely a competitor to ada for this sort of thing finance smart training is currently doing around three million transactions per day and if we go to ethereum you can see ethereum is doing around 1.3 million transactions per day both of these blockchains though are fully operating public blockchains with many dapps made on top of them cardano isn't yet it's still really in the test phases so we've got a long way to go for daily transactions but you can see the huge growth already as ada is scaling up we can also come down to the daily active staking wallets and you can see also huge growth in the amount of wallets actually staking ada we've seen this massive growth right here but don't expect too much over the coming months mainly because ada is now in a test net phase which i'll get onto later on in the video the next big phase of growth though is obviously when ada allows people to just publicly make decentralized applications on cardano without kodano inviting them specifically to come and test out the network next up i want to talk about project catalyst or the cadano treasury as you can see here there is a lot of money tied up in the treasury that cardano are going to use to pay people to develop dapps on top of the kadano blockchain obviously without dapps then no one can actually use the cardano blockchain kadano has a lot of cash right now that it's going to give to developers to make the competitive products to things like we know uniswap and other d5 platforms that are on binance smart chain on ethereum that's exactly what cadano wants to build including nft support as well one really important app that i've seen so far is something called liquid which is going to be a money market on cadano so think of rv or maybe compound or something like that a non-binance smart chain maybe venus which is essentially a liquidity protocol that lets people earn interest on deposits and other people to borrow those deposits you can see liquid on kadano is going to be a lending market for d fire creating an open source non-custodial liquidity protocol to earn interest on deposits and borrow assets on cadano it's really when protocols like this are actually functioning on kodano and people can put money into an app like this to earn interest on that's when new wallet creation and the amount of total value locked up in the smart chain is going to explode when we see actual user growth in cardano you could see a big big move to the upside in terms of the market cap and the price why would anyone that currently uses ave and uniswap and other d5 platforms on ethereum move over to cadano well the answer is incredibly simple and that is that on ethereum for right now you have to pay 20 30 even 50 or even more to send a transaction from one wallet to another it's absolutely absurd and that's compared to kodano which is expecting to have fees of around 15 cents and it may go up and down a little bit depending on network usage but that is a huge difference and obviously when it comes to finance people are just going to use the blockchain that gives them the best decentralization the best security and the lowest cost ethereum isn't dead of course there are many protocols coming in many upgrades directly to ethereum that are trying to sort out the fees issue but cadano certainly is poised to become a big competitor so definitely apps like liquid and some other apps that you can see are being built are worth watching for in the first two weeks of april we'll see a select group of developers testing out smart contracts on the platform and for me no news is good news here cardano is going to be tested out and usually when you open up a coding languages bugs are found this is totally normal and expected this is a risky time for ada holders for sure as i see this time now as the time when we're going to find out if carano can actually handle smart contracts without any really major issues issues would be things like bugs in the code that allow for double spending or security bugs that allow for hacks which has happened in many other blockchains and also has seen billions of dollars worth of cryptos stolen over the years so this is a time where we could wake up to some news that various bugs have been found in cardano or not as the case may be this is still a test phase though as we can see by the official kadano timeline so we would actually hope some minor bugs or issues to be found now and then to move on to the pioneers test net towards may and june where they can actually make things better over time charles hoskinson also told investors in one of his videos that he was looking for an official gogan event towards september time meaning that is another time frame we are looking at for news flow and price moves in ada if serious bugs are found expect delays to this time frame which could potentially weigh on the price of ada short term but just to be clear these are still test nets meaning we are actually still a while away from a functioning public blockchain here which in my opinion is when we could see way more value added to cadano as a blockchain and therefore we would expect the price of ada to rise further and possibly close the gap between its current market cap compared to ethereum i do always come back to the market cap evader also currently around 38 billion which is a hefty valuation for a blockchain that isn't really being used yet this could be said for polka dot 2 and others it's not specific to ada there's certainly a lot of value already and it does need to keep producing to keep the valuation moving upwards so it's great to see the really huge growth in cardano uptake in terms of wallet creation more users and transactions going through the network and 100 decentralized block production lots of potential news events coming in the spring with the test net usage and smart contracts being made on the blockchain possibly good news flow and also some potential issues bugs and other problems that may occur which is why they are moving to a test net now before the main net launch make sure to pick up your free crypto when you sign up for celsius wallet enter my code in the

25,C0KVtmodhJU," What would the crypto space look like if all 
blockchains had a common link to one another? Something like a superhighway for blockchains 
where Ethereum connected to Cardano and Bitcoin,   Bitcoin connected to Tezos 
and VeChain. Tron to Litecoin. Join us as we take a peek 
into THE chain to connect   all other blockchains – Let’s connect 
the dots and answer the question... What is Polkadot?
 
Launched in 2016, Polkadot is the   brainchild of Gavin Wood, an Ethereum co-founder 
and creator of Solidity, the programming language   used by Ethereum. Polkadot is now run by Web3 
Foundation and developed by Parity Technologies,   both of which Gavin is a co-founder of. Polkadot 
is what Gavin Wood envisioned as the next version   of Ethereum, and THIS is how it works.
 
The current blockchain landscape is,   at best, fragmented, with multiple, independent 
blockchains all operating in isolation. As yet,   there is no efficient way for these separate 
chains to operate and communicate with each other   to share data, transact, or exchange value.
 
Polkadot is working to correct this by providing   for the first time—cross-chain interoperability. 
Polkadot will allow any blockchain: private and   public, permissioned and permissionless, as well 
as oracles and decentralized apps to talk to   each other and be connected in a trustless way 
under a single decentralized Polkadot umbrella. Here’s a few examples of how this could work. A smart contract event on Ethereum 
triggers a payment on the Bitcoin network 
   An oracle that feeds price data to dozens 
of different blockchains at the same time
   This is why Polkadot is being 
called the Internet of Blockchains.   Like the Internet, Polkadot will 
behave as an interoperable network   connecting all blockchains.
 
How does it do this? Polkadot   will achieve it through the Polkadot Relay 
Chain, parachains and connectors called bridges. Polkadot’s Relay Chain is the core 
layer of the network and acts like   a bookkeeper overlooking all network transactions. Parachains are the second layer. They’re 
made up of individual blockchains all   connected in parallel. Hence, parallel 
chains or para-chains. Para-chains allow   multiple chains to run simultaneously to enable 
scalability and increase transaction speed.   They can be bought by cryptocurrency 
companies and customized to suit their needs.
   Thirdly, bridges. Polkadot will use Bridges to 
connect to difficult or established blockchains   like Bitcoin and Ethereum by writing 
a break-in or a break-out smart   contract that will allow these chains to 
communicate with the Polkadot network. But why is connecting blockchains valuable? And 
can Polkadot truly support the ever increasing   number of blockchains? Click the link above to 
read more about Polkadot in the Exodus blog. 
   Ok. Now that we know what Polkadot 
is, let’s dig into DOT. What exactly   is it and what is it used for?
 
$DOT is the native token of the   Polkadot network and is used for 3 main 
things: Governance, Staking and Bonding. First, Governance. All DOT token holders are 
given the right to vote over decisions that   govern the network, such as upgrades or changing 
network fees. Votes are weighted according to the   amount of tokens, and the agreed time period 
that the tokens are locked up with the vote.
   Next, Polkadot Staking. DOT holders 
can help secure the Polkadot network   by staking their tokens to the network as 
validators and nominators. Validators take   part in the minting of blocks while nominators 
back these validators up. Both provide important   security functions, and therefore receive 
$DOT as payout rewards as incentives. And third, Bonding. As mentioned earlier, 
Parachains can be bought. In order to buy   a parachain a user has to “bond” DOT 
in order to control the parachain.   Bonding ties DOT tokens to the Relay 
Chain whenever a new parachain is added. Polkadot aspires to build a multichain universe, 
where multiple blockchains can co-exist and   operate together to create a more vibrant, 
interoperable mega-system of blockchains. How do you envision an internet of blockchains 
working for you? Is this all hype or do you see   real value coming to your life because of it? 
Please share your thoughts in the comments. And if you’re a $DOT crypto token holder, 
let us know your Polkadot price prediction.

26,GcOKXAOh4Xw," We were just kind of thinking how we could maybe create the next version of Ethereum if we sort of had a green field to design upon. So we already have technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are able to, in some sense disintermediate many of the middlemen, many of the institutions and authorities, and remove the need for much of the trust in society. But what we currently have is a patchwork of, if you like, independent and isolated, legal systems of the Internet. And this is problematic, because it creates many different groups who, although they share the same vision, have misalignment in how they wish to achieve it. Creating borders where borders don't need to be there. We have this great new technology that is allowing us to automate one of the sort of very fundamental aspects of an economy, which is trust. Which is this idea that I can have reasonable expectations of what's going to happen without having to trust someone. There was a general idea back in 2014, when we were starting Ethereum, that Ethereum Two should be being under development by late 2016. And here we were sitting around in autumn of 2016 and there was absolutely no indication that there was going to be any development significant at least on Ethereum Two for some time. So really, we wanted to push forward with that one way or another. Let's embark on something that we think will be complementary to Ethereum Two, a system in parallel that can fulfil things that probably Ethereum Two is going to be less than optimal fulfilling. And ideally that will interoperate with Ethereum Two as well. So Polkadot is a multi-chain. The idea is that it's a blockchain, but we bundle lots of different blocks up all at the same time that can be executed in parallel. So these things can all be executed at the same time. In doing so, we create this sort of idea of a multi-chain, because every block is actually lots of different blocks that we can in principle run a hundred times the amount of transaction throughput that just one chain, like Bitcoin or Ethereum could. Polkadot is in many respects the biggest bet in this ecosystem against chain maximalism. Even if there were one perfect chain, I don't think it would stay perfect for very long. I would try to convince people that it's really not such a good plan to be so focussed on backing one winner above all others. I have here, fresh from the Apple store, a shrink-wrapped MacBook Pro. And I'm going to give you a demo of developing a custom blockchain and upgrading it online using this very computer. So let's see what I can do in 15 minutes. So we've downloaded a package called the Substrate Node Template. What this is, is a very small repository that acts as a sort of skeleton blockchain. Ultimately, we didn't end up using our sort of Ethereum technology set for implementing Polkadot. Instead, we created a sort of whole other one, Substrate. Now, Substrate is basically this blockchain framework. The idea is that you can make new blockchains from it. You can place this specialised logic and use the specialised logic in order to process transactions. It's written in such a way that it works both as a blockchain that just exists on its own, like Bitcoin and Ethereum and all the others. And it exists as a blockchain that exists under the Polkadot umbrella as one of these, what we call parachains, what some people call shards. At the moment, if you think you've got what it takes to develop a sort of low level technology, you go the whole hog and you write a whole new blockchain. And that takes a very, very, very long time and a lot of skill. I really hope we can create a whole new class of development teams and development application where, you don't have to know everything, you don't have to do everything to develop your whole new blockchain. But you can do just enough that you do have a, you know, a domain specific chain that has its own parameterisation and its own features that allow you to get a particular job done, and done well, that wouldn't have been possible before, because smart contracts are too bloaty and writing your own chain is too much work. And that is as simple as it is to create a whole new different chain, that has this whole new piece of functionality in Substrate. I feel that my value add for the world is in creating technical solutions for things and delivering them. If I don't build stuff for a while, then... I am in some sense addicted to it. This basically allows every coder to also be a businessman. They just place an algorithmic service online and it's a self-sovereign, autonomous, economically strong business. You heard the phrase, the pen is mightier than the sword? Well, you know, the keyboard is going to become even mightier than the pen, pretty soon. The world, in some sense, belongs to coders.","['We', 'were', 'just', 'kind', 'of', 'thinking', 'how', 'we', 'could', 'maybe', 'create', 'the', 'next', 'version', 'of', 'Ethereum', 'if', 'we', 'sort',

27,o2v5eGQqU8U, the crypto in blockchain world is changing right in front of our very eyes there's a reason why projects like avalanche cardano and polkadot are destroying the markets right now with each passing day the flaws of ethereum come more to the surface it's creating a high level of speculation when it comes to the next ethereum killer as they say but nothing will kill ethereum the bitcoin maxis have been trying that for years the rise in popularity of ethereum ironically is opening up the floodgates or other smart contract platforms and ecosystems to gain traction today i'm going to explain to you how this came to be and why polka dot is going to take the entire crypto space to a new level and then i'm going to give you a dot price prediction let's get it bid swap is the hottest new way to trade tokens probably all the top decentralized exchanges bitswap gives you the very best price and value for your trades bit swap is changing the game try it now at bitswap decks dot io welcome to bitboy crypto the number one channel in all of the interwebs my name is ben everyday on this channel i show you how to make money in cryptocurrency if you like money in crypto make sure to hit that subscribe button if you're a fan of polka dot then make sure to smash the like button for the youtube algorithm this helps our video overlords know that people enjoy polka dot content in this video we're going to be looking at polka dot and i'm going to explain to you how it is changing the game and why it's got so much potential then we'll be diving into a 2021 polka dot prize prediction now you guys have been waiting on it but first we have to look at how the crypto world is changing you can't talk smart contracts and decentralize ecosystems without first talking about ethereum because that's where it all started and actually kind of where polka dots started as well if you're unaware the founder of polkadot the good doctor gavin wood was also one of the co-founders of ethereum like cardano founder charles hoskinson he left ethereum and the foundation to create his own project that solved many of the issues that were bubbling up with ethereum you know the drill speed congestion high gas fees scalability etc hoskinson and wood were both able to launch projects with these problems already solved for so while ethereum is far and away the first mover in the space cardano and polkadot are playing the tortoise to ethereum's hair methodically and strategically positioning themselves to compete when the time is right we're moving very close to this time for years so many projects have been dubbed the ethereum killer neo was the first to wear the crown and we see how it worked out eos tron iost tezos and many others have fallen in line none have knocked teeth off here's why ethereum won't get knocked off it's too strong and too powerful right now even with all of its flaws if dot or ada eventually pass ethereum they aren't going to necessarily knock it out ethereum has the largest developer pool right now and it isn't going anywhere there's something though that we are seeing happen right in front of our eyes it's a beautiful thing to watch for years ethereum has had zero competitors many have tried but it's never felt like they were truly challenged you think the eth community was threatened by tron at one time i felt like tron could challenge it i was way wrong and the true people under the hood and the eth community laughed at me for thinking that it could one of my all-time favorite video games is mike tyson's punch-out as a kid i love that game even as an adult still i remember playing it all the time and mike tyson was so hard to beat why because in real life no one had ever even beaten him mike tyson at his peak was so much better than every other boxer out there that it was basically a torture exercise to pick his next opponent the guy across the ring for mike tyson never had a chance now the reverberating effects of this were huge mike tyson the greatest boxer of all time in my opinion at least the most dominant and fierce took his eyes off the prize he stopped focusing he didn't train as hard because he knew he had no competition then one day buster douglas showed up knocked him out greatest upset in sports history you see when there's no competition people and companies get lazy look at blockbuster for instance ethereum having these upcoming rivals is a great thing for the entire crypto space it lifts it up the business and financial sectors are waking up to the possibilities of blockchain ethereum's leading the way here but this is giving rise to new opportunities for decentralization and integration there's an almost endless amount of opportunities for ethereum cardano and polka dot it's not about which one of these projects wins they all win they're all going to eat away at traditional business models so let's take a look now at how polka dots specifically is going to get their piece of the proverbial pie contrary to popular belief very real pie is only second to peek and pie and the pie hierarchy but to summarize what polka dot is it's a multi-chain interchange with what we call pair chains no this is not the new rebrand for atl wrapper 2 chains it's different pair of chains are basically side chains that can be customized to be interoperable with other public blockchains while ethereum tokens get built on top of the ethereum code you can think of polka dot as an ecosystem where each token built in it connects to the polka dot chain this is why new polka dot ido's or initial dot offerings are about to be the hottest thing in crypto we will be covering some of these ideos soon so make sure to subscribe so you get the latest info on these new projects as they come out there are going to be so many good ones there already have been in addition to the pair chains infrastructure the other thing that kind of defines polka dot is its backwards compatibility to ethereum polka dot adapts to the current ethereum network but ethereum doesn't adapt to the polka dot network you kind of think of it like this on uniswap you can currently exchange ethereum tokens for one another you can't exchange an ethereum token for a polka dot token directly on an ethereum decentralized exchange like uniswap or bitswap but you can exchange a polka dot token for an ethereum token on polka dot dexes like pokeswap when it fully launches trying to explain how to use a decentralized exchange to someone newer to crypto is difficult enough by itself i just did it last night but then trying to explain to them how they can only exchange erc 20 tokens on uniswap or bitswap leaves them scratching their heads they don't even know what that means so the point is while unispot has been crushing it last year why would you use uniswap if a dex existed to where you could trade all coins including bitcoin without the need for rap tokens like rap btc in short you wouldn't there'd be no reason to and i can tell you this one of the top questions that i get asked all the time is which exchange out there exists where people can get access to every coin in short it doesn't exist at least yet you're handcuffed by erc 20s or other erc token standards on unit swap and buy whatever coins are listed on american exchanges like coinbase or binance us polkadot can change that and investors around the world are taking notice of the insane potential of dot's ecosystem that's one reason why dot is absolutely pumped over the last month and a half when you look at its numbers wow as dot was crushing all-time highs it also was announced that an index fund in switzerland was launching on a stock exchange think greyscale trust for polka dot but just from a different company one of the biggest opportunities of course for polka dot is in the world of d5 which is where ethereum shine brightest amid its flaws last summer was insane and so many killer projects launched and pumped in d5 but now even some of the biggest d5 winners are starting to investigate the prospects of a multi-chain interoperable ecosystem like dot one of those projects is curve equilibrium a market maker company is going to be building cross chain integration to polka dot and i doubt the curve is the only or the last project that will be branching out to the new ecosystem part of the huge defy run over the summer was the ease at which new finance projects were launched via unit swap we could be getting ready to see the same thing for polka dot and its idos a dot d by explosion sounds good to me but how much can the cost of the polka dot coin actually increase dot's up 200 over the last 30 days but here's the thing polka dots started out with a much bigger launch than other projects it debuted in the top ten pretty hefty accomplishment way more than gavin woods barber could ever hope to achieve in my opinion this still gives dot a pretty high ceiling but eventually it could run into some problems due to the fact that many investors will look at it as not having as high potential is lower ranked projects with smaller caps now i believe from here dot can see a 13x by the end of 2021 giving it a price of 326 dollars per dot expensive little tittles but that would give dot about a 300 billion dollar market cap what do you think where do you believe polka dot can go from here also do you know what a tittle is drop your comments down below also smash the like button if you want more polka dot that's all i got be blessed big boy out [Music]

or are looking to learn even more about crypto,   be sure to checkout and subscribe to our new 
youtube channel after this video dedicated to   all things crypto. Find new videos every week. 
Be sure to check the link in the description. SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Hello, Real Vision 
people. This is Sebastian Moonjava. Today,   I have a very special guest, Gavin Wood. 
He is the founder of Parity, Polkadot,   Web3 Foundation and Ethereum. I am so glad 
to have you here, Gavin, how are you doing?  GAVIN WOOD: Hi, Sebastian. I'm doing well. Thanks.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Let's start off with a little   bit about your background, getting into crypto in
the first place, and then maybe a little bit   about your experience with Ethereum. GAVIN 
WOOD: Sure, you want me to kick it off?  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Yeah. Tell us a little 
bit about yourself, your background,   how you even got started in the space.
GAVIN WOOD: Alright. Well, it's a long   story. I went to university. I did like a 
PhD in Computer Science, but I was always   super into things like Game Theory, a little 
bit of social science, political science. This   was always on the back burner, generally, 
pub conversations, but quite in-depth ones.   I noticed this thing called Bitcoin back in 2011, 
or something, but I only actually took a deep look   into it in 2013. At around the same time, I was 
actually doing a startup with an old friend,   a software for lawyers to help lawyers author 
their contracts, dumb contracts, paper contract.  Towards the end of 2013, I got talking to a few 
people in the Bitcoin community in London quite   regularly. One of the people I met was Vitalik, 
who has just done this initial whitepaper for   this thing called Ethereum. I was looking for a 
little gig on the side, so I said, yeah, sure,   I'll code it up for you. Ethereum took off quite 
a lot in 2014, and 2015. I was the initial CTO for   Ethereum Foundation, and it was basically down 
to me to make sure the thing actually launched,   which it did properly in mid-2015.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: The workhorse.  GAVIN WOOD: The workhorse. Yeah, that's it, 
running around. I left the Ethereum Foundation   late 2015 to do Ethcore, as it was called back 
then, a private company operating within the   Ethereum ecosystem. That eventually became Parity 
when we branched out to things beyond Ethereum, we   did our own Bitcoin client, and then eventually, 
2016, I put forward this idea for Polkadot,   which is the project that I'm still working 
on that Parity is fairly wholly behind now.   It's this idea for basically a chain of chains, a 
blockchain of blockchains, protocol of protocols.   Basically going a bit one layer down in the stack 
and seeing if we can abstract and generalize over   what we built before with Ethereum and Bitcoin.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: The overarching goal of   Polkadot is to what? Is this for interoperability? 
What is the problem that it's solving?  GAVIN WOOD: There's a lot of angles on 
this question. It's a very interesting one,   because we are dealing with such deep tech. If 
you like, I think the one that gets to the crux   of it for me is innovation. We are solving the 
problem of innovating fast. The problem is that   if you want to innovate, you want to build a
new blockchain, you want to build new business   logic, you have to do an awful lot of work 
to get a relatively small amount back.  What Polkadot does is it allows you to 
shortcut on an awful lot of that work,   it allows you to shortcut on an awful lot 
of stuff that you have to do to build your   own blockchain. It also allows you --
JASON ZIEMIANSKI: What we're showing   you here on our YouTube channel

click on the link in the description,   go to realvision.com, and see what you 
think. We look forward to seeing you there. GAVIN WOOD: is it allows you to shortcut on 
an awful lot of that work, it allows you to   shortcut on an awful lot of stuff that you 
have to do to build your own blockchain.   It also allows you to shortcut on things like 
building your own community, it allows you to   shortcut on stuff like being able to utilize all 
of the various other bits that are going on in   other blockchains. It does this by connecting, 
allowing to connect to those other chains.   It also very crucially allows you to avoid having 
to build your own base, your own security base.  Blockchains, this is very important. 
They have to provide their own security.   Bitcoin famously has the mining algorithm. 
I don't know, it uses up the equivalent of,   I don't know, some small country's energy simply 
in securing itself. Of course, the newer chains   tend not to be proof of work, they tend to be 
proof of stake so they're not using much energy,   but they are using a lot of capital. A lot of 
capital allocation has to go into this proof   of stake, so that the chain actually is secure, 
because it's this capital that's securing it.  The problem is that you've got many different 
proof of stake chains, each doing their own   different thing, then that capital has to be 
divided between these chains to secure each of   them rather than being pooled together and having 
the whole capital base securing all of the chains.   That's really one of the key problems that 
Polkadot solves, it allows the same capital   base to secure many different 
domain specific blockchains.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Can you 
tell me a little bit more about   how they get this groups together security? 
I hear this word parachains coming up often,   can you tell me a little bit about 
how that security is different?   How it's getting it's security from the main 
Substrate as opposed to how Ethereum works?  GAVIN WOOD: In essence, there's two 
different things going on here. One of them,   you can look at it as like Polkadot 
is a bunch of different blockchains,   independent blockchains doing their own thing. 
Then every now and again, every six seconds as it   turns out, these blockchains are allowed to send 
messages to each other. There's a point during a   period, an interval in which they are allowed 
to communicate. Other than that, they're doing   their own work, a little bit like your traditional 
idea of an office worker, they spend an hour doing   their own thing, filling in forms, writing memos, 
all the rest of it. Then at the end of the hour,   they might have some communication, they might 
take a meeting or have a call or whatever.  It's like these blockchains, we call them 
parachains, they're going off doing their   own work for six seconds then coming back and 
conferring with each other, exchanging messages,   and catching up. Now, how do they get 
security? Do they share security? Well,   that essentially comes down to this one chain, the 
relay chain, we call it as the heart of Polkadot.   This chain has a bunch of validators. These 
validators, as I said before, they're bonded,   so they've got this capital backing. This 
capital can be lost if these guys misbehave,   so they're trusted in some sense of the word.
The kind of trust that they're not really just   acting in their own self-interest. Because if 
they misbehave, they lose potentially quite a lot   of money. Now, these guys are split. When Polkadot 
is going fully, properly, expanded, and it's   really going, probably in six months' time, 
there's going to be about 1000 of these guys.  The idea is that we split them into 
100 subgroups of 10. Each subgroup,   each of these 10 validators get randomly assigned 
to one of these chains, one of these parachains,   of which we expect that to be probably about 100.
They check, they make sure that the parachains   are actually operating correctly, that no one's 
trying to do anything bad or malicious on the   parachain. Basically, they make sure the system 
retains its integrity. This gets swapped out   every six seconds. What that means is that 
even if you compromise one of these groups,   it's very difficult to get a long run, it's 
basically impossible to get a long run of   blocks, of six second blocks, in order 
to really make any attack feasible.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: All have these, and 
like you said, there'll be many of these   over the next several months that are coming 
out. They are, again, all getting their   security from this central relay chain. Can 
you give me an example of what some of these   parachains might be doing? It can be anything, 
right? Can you go into a little bit of detail   about what is possible on these parachains?
GAVIN WOOD: Yeah. The great thing about   parachains, the way that I designed Polkadot 
back at the beginning, was really to try and   make it as general as possible. We do that in, 
first lesson of computer science, we do that by   making it as abstract as possible. We're really 
trying to get rid of anything that's particularly   concrete or more specific to what the--
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: This is more so than Ethereum,   because usually the comparisons are like, 
we've got Bitcoin, then we've got Ethereum,   which made it a little bit more abstract. 
Is this even more abstract than Ethereum?  GAVIN WOOD: Substantially more. Yeah. I was 
that back in the day when we're trying to pitch   Ethereum to the world. It's fair to say that 
Ethereum is more general purpose than Bitcoin.   Bitcoin has a relatively limited ability to be 
scripted. You can attach certain conditions,   some scripting conditions to the payments 
that you make in Bitcoin, but relatively few.   With Ethereum, that scripting, those conditions 
that you could make became substantially greater,   a lot more flexible. You could do things like 
loops in them, which computer scientists will   know can give rise to Turing completeness.
This allows you to do all sorts of crazy weird   and wonderful experiments on Ethereum, but there's 
a big issue with Ethereum. That's what's called   gas, and gas is this idea that you're metering 
how much computation that's being done. Every   single transaction is being metered. What the 
metering means is that every single instruction,   these instructions are very tiny little things, 
things like add these two numbers, or look this   thing up in memory, these instructions, each and 
every one of them being counted, being metered,   and this metering is very, very expensive.
What that ultimately means is that   running complex, sophisticated programs on 
Ethereum is extremely expensive. It works,   don't get me wrong, but it's very expensive. You 
can see this already today with defi slowly being   throttled by the amount of costs associated with 
the gas price. Now what we do is we say, well,   actually, this level of abstraction is good in its 
general purpose but it's not the lowest level that   we can go to, and we go to an even lower level.
Within Polkadot, we don't have the notion of gas,   we don't have the notion of accounts or account 
balances. We don't have any of these ideas that   are we don't-- like Ethereum has ether and every 
computer program that you write and upload to   Ethereum has to be associated with an account 
that holds ether. Every time anyone uses that   computer program, they have to have some ether 
to pay Ethereum to run the program for them.   That isn't the case in Polkadot.
In Polkadot, it's very simple. The team   behind the program uploads that program. They do 
it as a blockchain. The program is actually a very   large program that contains all of the various 
business logic for an application or potentially   many different applications. They upload this into 
Polkadot, and then they pay for that blockchain,   that parachain to be there by virtue 
of this deposit of a leasing system.  Once it's paid, it's done. At that point, 
the users of this computer program never even   have to know about Polkadot, they never have to 
know about the DOT token or anything to do with   that stuff. All they care about is basically 
what is the business logic of this chain.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Is this like-- it's like lump 
sum payment for a lease for a certain period of   time, then they get as much accessibility to 
the computing as they need. That's great. Can   you maybe give a little compare and contrast of 
what the parachain and maybe the initial parachain   offerings that I'm hearing about. Is it like the 
way that they're bootstrapping their security?  Can you maybe give a comparison to the ICO things 
that happen on Ethereum, where in Ethereum,   they were the ICOs were trying to raise capital 
maybe to build out one of these projects, which is   significantly different than what your thing 
is, because some of these parachain offerings,   I believe, if I'm correct here, is that 
they're trying to bootstrap this like payment   that you're talking about for their lease for them 
to be able to run this constantly. Can you maybe   go into a little bit about the differences here?
GAVIN WOOD: Yeah. We were trying to avoid   that specific term, because it tends to lead 
to misunderstandings with precisely what's   happening. In reality, what's going on with-- I've 
mentioned leases. There's this idea that we have a   finite number of slots, probably around 100 once 
Polkadot is probably going. Parachains can occupy   one of these slots when they run. There's 
one of the interesting parachains called   Acala, these guys are essentially trying to make 
a decentralized finance chain, it's got Ethereum   Virtual Machine compatibility, so people can 
easily upload their Ethereum programs into it.  It can also do all sorts of other things. It's 
got a stablecoin on it, all this kind of stuff.   Now, if these guys want to take a slot, then they 
have to put down a lease, someone somewhere has to   basically put down more DOT tokens than anybody 
else in the world who is willing to deposit   for the slot. Now, these DOT tokens don't go 
anywhere, they just get locked. They can't   be transferred out, or anything like that.
They don't go anywhere. They stay within   the account of the leaser, the person 
who's putting the DOT tokens down,   and six months or whatever, however 
long it takes before the lease   expires, those tokens are eventually freed up. 
They don't go anywhere. They are all 100% stuck   within the Polkadot system. There's no chance 
of them being slashed or reduced in balance.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: As in opposition and in 
difference to the ICOs that we saw on 2017,   there is no swapping out. This is just to drive 
home your point more that these tokens are just   pretty much placed here, left alone. There's 
no, oh, hey, I'm giving you this, and you're   giving me that. It's just I'm providing security 
or saying, yeah, these people need the security.   I think it's a good project for Polkadot so 
I will push this here and lock it in there.  GAVIN WOOD: Yeah, it's just a way of determining 
the value of one project against another. The   value is just measured by many people are 
willing to lock up how many DOT tokens   behind this project, but that's only locked up 
as long as the project's actually got an active   parachain. As soon as the project loses that 
parachain, like they find an alternative means   of releasing such a slot, then those tokens are 
freed up and they get-- not returned because that   would imply that they left in the first place, but 
simply placed back under normal use of the owner.  Now, of course, Acala probably, and various 
other parachain teams that are out there,   don't have those DOT tokens themselves. 
What they want to be able to do is basically   say to the various DOT token holders of the 
world, hey, put your DOT token-- sponsor us   with a deposit of your DOT tokens. Don't give 
them to us, just put them behind our chain,   our project, as long as it's a parachain.
Maybe you do it for the good of your heart.   Maybe you do it because you think this is 
a really worthwhile project. Maybe you do   it because the project is going to offer you 
some benefit, it might give you some on- chain,   I don't know, receipt or record that can be used 
in the future for some gain of some sort. Now,   this we call a crowd loan, because it's basically 
you're taking to the crowd and you're saying,   look, please loan the system some 
of your tokens in order for us to   be able to put forward our chain and get 
one of these slots and run on Polkadot.  The key difference is that these tokens 
never leave the ownership of the crowd,   the crowd members. They retain ownership, it's 
just that it gets placed behind the parachain.   Once it's placed behind that one parachain, 
it can't be used for other stuff like staking,   or other parachains or obviously can't 
be sent to any third party as well.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: That's great. I would love 
to hear a bit about Kusama. Full disclosure, I   own some Polkadot, I own some Kusama, but I think 
this really interesting stuff especially like   the Kusama society stuff is very interesting. 
I'd love for you to just give us an overview of   what in the world is Kusama? How does it relate 
to Polkadot and the ecosystem as a whole as well?  GAVIN WOOD: Sure. Kusama, we call it a canary 
network, a canary chain. You're familiar with test   networks, this is the idea of basically a network 
that has no value. Bitcoin has a test network,   there's a few others. That just sticks around in 
the background, usually software that's going to   eventually be rolled out to the Mainnet, that main 
network of a cryptocurrency or blockchain, will be   first rolled out to one of these testnets just 
to make sure it's doing roughly the right thing.  The problem with testnets are that they can't be 
used to test the things that require some degree   of a value signal. For example, governance. 
Governance, stakeholder voting, this kind of   stakeholder participation, this kind of 
stuff is pointless to do on a testnet,   because who's going to be interested in voting 
on a network that has literally zero value? It   doesn't make any sense. No one's going 
to dedicate their time to doing that.  What we do for Polkadot, because we 
really wanted to test this stuff,   we're breaking new ground in terms of on-chain 
governance with Polkadot, and we really needed   to test it before we launched a multibillion 
dollar market cap network that's governed   by an algorithm. We introduced first Kusama, 
a very low value network, but still a network   that in principle has scarcity and people have 
given value over time. Kusama is there to make   sure that our various algorithms be there for 
governance, for just new features, innovations,   experiments that we think might be good but 
might not be good, they might not work out.  These are all things that can be pushed onto 
Kusama to try it in the real world with real stake   albeit not as much stake perhaps as one of the 
top networks but still enough stake to make it   worthwhile for people to actually interact with 
the test out and first, to see actually how it   works with real people. Now, in addition to that, 
of course, Kusama is a fast moving no promises,   expect chaos, break it attitude for a network, 
which is quite different to a lot of blockchains,   what blockchains really push for their stability, 
robustness, reliability as Polkadot indeed does.  Really, we wanted an alternative out there 
that's using the same kind of technology,   but with a completely different mindset. 
That's really what Kusama fulfills.   It's like if you've got an experiment, you want 
to try a social experiment, put it on Kusama.   Don't put it on Polkadot. Polkadot's there for 
the production industry capable applications.   Kusama is really there for interesting 
experimentation, particularly social experiments.  The society is one of these social experiments. 
The idea is to say, well, we've got the idea of   blockchain, where you've got these blocks, they're 
full of transactions, the next block references   the previous block, and you're building a ledger 
up from nothing out of these references or the one   thing referencing the previous thing. Can we do 
that? Can we make it more tangible? Because blocks   are not very tangible, you try and explain this 
to my mother, she won't really know what you're   talking about. Blocks what? Wooden blocks?
The society is what's called also the human   blockchain. This is the idea that you can make a 
blockchain out of people, but rather than these   abstract blocks full of transactions, you've got 
literally human beings, and the human beings,   as a new one is added onto the human blockchain, 
they reference an old one. We've got this society,   I think there's 50 members now, all around the 
world, most of them don't know the others. Each of   them have tattooed crazily enough onto their body, 
a reference to another member of this society.  It's all public, you can see the tattoos, and 
every now and again, one is chosen at random,   and they have to actually prove that they still 
have the tattoo. They have to prove to the other   members of the society that they did indeed get 
the tattoo. It's really just a social experiment,   but it's something that using to show that 
blockchains actually can be used to make a   fairly arbitrary difference into people's lives.
There's a few other bits that Kusama is doing.   It's quite heavily supportive of the 
art world. There are a few projects that   Kusama is funding within the art world to try 
and bring a bit more knowledge about blockchain,  a bit more awareness into circles that 
blockchain wouldn't otherwise get exposed to.   Overall, it's like Kusama's treasury, its on-chain 
governance so it hasn't fairly substantially   funded treasury now. The on- chain governance 
can control this treasury and Kusama is fairly   active in using these funds to support various 
projects to bring about awareness and education.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: A couple of things that 
are coming to mind as you're talking is one,   can you talk to me maybe a little bit about, I'm 
not sure, maybe the cadence of-- I was reading   about like Moonbeam is working on a Kusama 
version, or they're going to launch a project   on there. Then they're going to do it on Polkadot 
as well. Maybe, can you talk to me about like the   process that you would imagine that a team looking 
to build a parachain, would they go to Kusama   first, and then they would go on to Polkadot? 
Can you describe how you see this process?  GAVIN WOOD: Yeah. It's certainly one way of doing 
it. I wouldn't necessarily expect all teams to go   first to a test, we always have a testnet. That's 
what's running at the moment. We call the testnet   Rococo. It started just before Christmas I 
think. It's been accepting parachain teams   to be brought on over the last week or two.
The first step is really get your parachain   working just on your little local computer. 
The next step is to get it onto Rococo. We'd   expect most people, most teams like Moonbeam 
to be deploying onto the Rococo testnet.   Kusama, they may also choose to do. It depends 
whether it makes sense for the team to have two   valuable networks going, one is a parachain on 
Polkadot and the other is a parachain on Kusama.   Could be that some teams don't need that for their 
project as it makes sense to deploy on Polkadot.  Could be like a small project, maybe a social 
experiment, maybe they don't have that much   funding, or they can't get that much backing, 
and that they're perfectly happy with being on   Kusama. It could be that another team just jumped 
straight to Polkadot. They know that their stuff   works. They've tested it locally, they tested on 
the Rococo testnet. They don't need to bother.   For them, maybe the security of Kusama isn't 
sufficient or maybe just that the other parachains   on Kusama are not going to give them a sufficient 
value add for them to be connected into them.   Instead, they just jumped straight to Polkadot.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Related to this, one,   the governance of these protocols, and I pretty 
much already know the answer this question,   but I want to ask it anyways, who is in charge of 
Kusama, who is governing Kusama? Is it Polkadot?  GAVIN WOOD: No. Actually, the funny thing here is 
that, if anything, it's the other way around. No,   there's about 19 people like that, it was 19 that 
are-- it might be 17, one or the other governing,   in principle, the Council, the Kusama Council, 
and they don't have any actual real power,   but they have some degree of executive power. It's 
a little bit similar to the UK political system,   some people might be familiar with 
it. Basically, any legislation   has to be still put through the full chamber or 
the referendum, as it is in Kusama as we call it.  The Council, which is a little bit akin 
to the executive body like the government,   are the ones that most of the time put forward 
the things to be voted on. It's like they say,   yeah, we think this is a good idea. Please
vote for it. Then it goes into the referendum to   be voted through. The interesting thing here 
is, though, that Polkadot, the DOT tokens,   we originally mentioned that we're going to 
be giving 10 million DOT tokens to Kusama,   one way or another. We hadn't decided back when 
we announced it like a year and a half ago.  The likelihood now is that we will literally be 
bestowing 10 million DOT tokens under the control   of the Kusama governance mechanism. 
It'll be fully decentralized. In reality,   Kusama or the Kusama governance mechanism 
will have a voice in how Polkadot is run.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Because I've talked 
to other people about this relationship   between Kusama and Polkadot, and because of 
this governance thing, that's why I asked,   is that Kusama can become its own thing. One 
of the main differentiators and maybe you can   talk about this as well, I wanted to touch 
on treasury stuff too. If you can touch on,   again, the main differentiators, you can 
call it whatever you want. You can say, oh,   this is a testnet, or it's a whatever you want to 
call it, but in reality, it's governed by itself.  It's beholden only to itself. It's evolving 
over time. This relationship can really be   different later. Can you tell me some of the key 
differences? One of the ones I know off the top of   my head is like, for decision making, or let's say 
unlocking of staked DOT takes 28 days or a month,   and then unlocking of Kusama is seven days. 
There's a significant difference in some of these   things. Can you talk about why those decisions 
are made, or what are the implications of some   of these differences between Kusama and Polkadot?
GAVIN WOOD: Yeah. Primarily, Kusama is this   live fast, die young kind of network. It's pushing 
the limits a little bit harder than Polkadot.   It's giving up some of the-- potentially some of 
the robustness and reliability, but in exchange   for the very latest technology, for the ability 
to change, for the ability to adapt a lot faster.   Ultimately, these, to a large degree, are 
a tradeoff. Now, you can argue maybe they   can add some cleverness and have both very fast 
changeability and extremely high reliability, but   I would say in general, it's a tradeoff between 
the two. Kusama is trading off the reliability.  Other things that are like this, probably like 
the auction, the parachain lease slots on Kusama   are going to be probably four times shorter. 
Instead of six months, there'll be only six   weeks. This means there's going to be probably a 
lot more parachain churn, and they'll come and go.  The governance in general for Kusama has shorter 
term limits. The council is reevaluated--   is it once a day still? I think it's 
still once a day, but in Polkadot,   it will eventually become once a month. In 
Kusama, it might eventually become once a week,   but there's generally this four to one ratio. 
If in Polkadot, it takes four months, in Kusama,   it only takes one month. It takes four days.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Again, it's much faster.   Kusama is able to mobilize, add 
additional technology features,   make decisions about governance and maybe treasury 
at four times the speed that Polkadot can.   Let's talk a little bit about treasury, which 
I think is like a really interesting thing.   DOT Kusama, again, whenever I talk to 
people I say, the DOT Kusama ecosystem.   In this space, talk to me a little bit 
about how the treasury works or like,   because DOT does have a little bit of inflation 
depending on how much is staked, is that correct?  Can you talk about the decision making behind 
this? I assume that this is so that you can   develop faster, make more-- because I know 
Decred had worked on like a treasury system   that's taken from some of the miners and stuff and 
that helps develop and build a robust ecosystem.   Can you talk to me a little bit about how the 
treasury works? How they're getting funds for   the treasury and how they deploy that capital?
GAVIN WOOD: Sure. The funds, actually,   they come from a few sources. The source-- but one 
of the sources that you already mentioned, this is   essentially the suboptimality of the staking 
system. What we do is-- I don't want too   deep down into the math, but essentially, we named 
an optimal amount of the total issuance of the DOT   token to be staked. At the moment, it's 75%. We 
say, we the governance of Polkadot declare that   we want 75% of the DOT tokens issued to be locked 
under the staking system. If it's any more, or if   it's any less, then we consider it suboptimal.
Now, as part of the algorithm by which we   determine how much rewards each of the validators 
should get, each of the stakeholders should get,   it turns out happily enough, that that 75%, to 
make 75% be the perfect number for everybody,   it turns out that only at 75% do we need the 
maximum amount of rewards of total costs of   the network. Now, we say well, for that for the 
moment, it's 10%. We say 10% per year is the   inflation. We inflate the token base by 10%, and 
that 10%, we allocate to the staking to rewards.  Here's the thing, if there is anything other 
than 75% of tokens staked, then it means we're   not going to use the whole 10%, we'll use less of 
it, that's just the way that the math works out.   This means that what we do is we send the rest of 
it, we could just not use it, we could burn it,   we could never inflate the token based 
higher. Instead, we take the more progressive   approach, and we put it in the treasury, in 
the Polkadot treasury, or the Kusama treasury.   Once it's in the treasury, then it's open to being 
spent by the delegated Council, these 19 or 17   people in Kusama. I think it's 
still 11 people in Polkadot.  Now, these guys can basically, a majority 
vote from them can basically spend what's   in the treasury. This is all super 
in the open, it's all on-chain.   You can go to chat rooms and see what's going 
on. There's forums and all the rest of it.   Now, if for some reason, the council choose not 
to spend it, or there's nothing good to spend   it on or whatever, so basically, if there's 
an overrun, if there's a treasury overrun,   a budget overrun, we're running a 
surplus, and then we actually burn it.   We took it in the incinerator and the DOT tokens 
just go out of the system, the issuance drops.  There is this additional deflationary pressure, 
it's not just we inflate 10% per year regardless,   but we inflate up to 10%. If it turns out that 
the staking is suboptimal, and the treasury can't   spend the funds, then those tokens essentially 
never get issued. What's it being used for?   There's a bunch of-- Kusama has quite a lot of 
crazy stuff that it's using it for. Actually with   Kusama, rather than just being about the Kusama 
network, it's also trying to raise, as I say,   awareness in more general circles, so there's 
a few artistic endeavors going on within that   are being funded on their own, fairly small bits 
of funding, but still being funded from Kusama.  Polkadot does tend to be a bit more focused. 
Obviously, the Polkadot treasury has more notional   capital funding, owing to it being a widely 
more valued network. The stuff that goes on   is running infrastructure within the community, 
so one of the first things that the Polkadot   treasury was used for was running a very widely 
used explorer, a blockchain explorer, a website   where you can check the history of transactions.
Also, development, various projects have had their   technology been funded by the Polkadot treasury. 
Of course, this is all open source, so everyone   can benefit from it, and there's a few other bits.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: These people that are wanting   to get funding, let's say, your example of a block 
explorer, this person would put in a proposal   right to the treasury to say, hey, I 
think I can add value to this network,   can I get some of this inflation or this treasury 
funding? Then the group of people, the Council   would be making a vote to say, yeah, we think that 
that is worthwhile for us to use those treasury   funds to build out this infrastructure.
GAVIN WOOD: That's exactly right. Now,   the interesting thing there's actually three 
ways that the treasury can be used. Three   methods. One of them is precisely that. Someone 
comes forward, they say, hey, I've got a proposal,   please give me some funds because I did this 
cool thing, or I want to do this cool thing.   It's great for Polkadot. It's great for 
Kusama. If the Council votes on it, fine.  There are two other ways. One of them is that is 
what we call the bounties. This is the opposite   way around. This is where the Council says, we 
want this thing doing, and we will pay this much.   We're delegating this curator to make sure that 
it's actually done, and they basically are in   charge of making sure that the funds are properly 
spent. We want this goal achieving, who out there   would like to achieve it? They put out a call to 
action or a request for proposals or something.  Then the other thing is what 
we call on-chain tipping.   This is where basically, someone has done 
something, usually a very small thing,   but still something that is a nice thing, it's 
like maybe they've written a little blog post or   done some nice pottery, or something, somehow 
made more people aware of the network or done   some useful educational technology for it. 
Basically, someone will report this is a   nice little good thing, and then the council, 
rather than having a specific spending proposal,   each of the members will say, yeah, I think 
this should be tipped one and a half Dots.  Then as each of the council members fill in 
what they think it's worth, if it's worth a   tip at all, what tip it's worth, there will 
eventually be a quorum of council members,   I think it's usually half of them, maybe half 
plus one. At that point, there's a countdown,   and there's like 24 hours in case any other 
council members want to chime in and put what   they think. Then after that, it's just the median. 
The median tip is chosen, and it's given to   whoever reported that or split between 
whoever reported and whoever actually did it.  This this really just allows a much faster 
moving process rather than having to, well,   I'm thinking of doing this blog post, I 
would like to be paid such and such for it,   and all the rest of it. It's just much faster.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Also, related to governance   and treasury and stuff, there was this 
thing that I read about Polkadot, Kusama,   they're trying to be like forkless blockchains, 
is that correct? Can you explain what that means,   and what the benefits are to that?
GAVIN WOOD: Yeah. This is something   that I personally worked on. It was my little 
baby that I did when I started. I worked   on it three years ago now. It was the first 
thing I worked on with regards to Polkadot.  Essentially, Polkadot does things differently to 
almost every other protocol out there, including   the very well- known ones. It's what's called 
a meta protocol, a blockchain meta protocol.  What this means is that the protocol, the 
thing that people associate with Polkadot,   so parachains and governance and balances and DOT 
tokens and all that stuff, that's not actually   part of the underlying protocol. That's the 
underlying thing that runs on the network.   That's actually a business logic that sits on top 
of the protocol and it's entirely programmatic.   What that means is it can be swapped out 
at any point in Polkadot's future for some   other business logic, alterations to it.
The actual protocol, the thing that is   defined as being Polkadot and is very difficult to 
change is actually very, very thin. It's all the   underlying consensus, which are called BABE and 
GRANDPA, that is a hybrid consensus but two bits.   A bit similar to Ethereum 2's consensus and a 
fairly substantial move forward from all the   existing consensus mechanisms. A layer on top of 
that that just says how to execute business logic.   We explicitly chose the most general industry, 
widespread industry adopted language, if you like,   format called WebAssembly, it's backed by Google 
and Firefox, and Microsoft and all the big ones.  It's very well understood, it's got a lot of big 
tech backing. It's simple. It's well designed.   It's very highly performance, very efficient, 
lots of good implementations. It's got this   big community around it. Basically, we just said, 
like, we don't need to invent our own thing. We're   not going to reinvent EVM, the Ethereum Virtual 
Machine, like we did back in the day. This is   going to be industry standard, WebAssembly sorted.
We basically just plugged WebAssembly into   the blockchain consensus and a database and 
stuff. That's what we call Substrate. Now,   this is what Polkadot runs on. All the stuff to do 
with Polkadot pretty much runs on top within this   WebAssembly thing. That means we can switch it 
out. What this means is that we can do upgrades to   it without having to do these horrible hard forks, 
where we're actually altering the underlying   protocol, and because these hard forks are really 
messy and if there's ever any disagreement over   whether they should be done or not, it's like, 
oh, no, I don't think this upgrade should happen.   I don't think it's-- maybe it's political, 
you're going to get people disagreeing,   then you're going to end up with forks 
of the networks, you're going to end   up with another Ethereum Classic or whatever.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Can you walk the audience   through what is a hard fork in general, and 
why do we want to avoid it? Maybe you can   talk about Ethereum Classic, or just give an 
example, so our audience understands what is   a hard fork, why do we want to not do that?
GAVIN WOOD: Sure. Basically, blockchains are   consensus systems. They exist as a way of allowing 
people, many different economic interests, often   around the world and the different jurisdictions 
that may not be especially easily compatible.   They allow all these economic actors to 
participate under the same economic rules. Now,   this is a fundamental innovation. It's why people 
are so excited about blockchain because it allows   for this consensus to happen independently of any 
of the legal systems that exist in the world, any   of the financial systems that exist in the world.
What happens if you need to agree something that   isn't a part, isn't within this consensus, 
isn't within the scope of forming a consensus?   Bitcoin allows you to form a consensus 
over who was paid Bitcoin in the  past and who to, but it doesn't 
allow you to form a consensus on how   Bitcoin should be upgraded. That's not within the 
system of a Bitcoin system. The system of Bitcoin   only considers account balances, and whether a 
particular transaction has been spent on them.  Same with Ethereum. Ethereum is very good at 
forming consensus over certain little computer   programs, but it can't form a consensus over how 
Ethereum itself is going to adapt to changes in   the future. That's outside of the system that's 
outside of the scope of Ethereum's consensus.   The same is true basically, for every blockchain 
out there, apart from Polkadot. With Polkadot,   the entire system, the business logic of Polkadot 
itself is contained within the Polkadot consensus.  Now, if you don't have this, then you have to 
find another way of achieving consensus outside of   the system. You have to find a way of all of the 
participants of the system, all the stakeholders   forming a consensus. Now, this might be done by 
having a benevolent dictator who just says, this   is what we're doing. It might be done by having 
a vote, and everyone committing to the outcome   of that vote. As we've seen in recent history, 
it's not always so easy to even agree upon the   outcome of the vote, let alone get everyone 
to agree to commit into it in the first place.  What we end up with is the problem that Bitcoin 
and Ethereum have gone through in the past,   where we see Bitcoin was forked off into 
Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision   and Bitcoin gold and Bitcoin diamond, and 
all the rest of the [?] Bitcoin, because   this consensus couldn't-- there was no way 
of forming a consensus long term over how   the protocol should be changed, should be adapted 
and evolved. The same with Ethereum. There was a   political decision to be made in Ethereum back in 
2016, when there was this big hack, the DAO hack,   whether the funds of the DAO that were hacked in 
the DAO hack should have been, basically rescued   and returned to the original owners or not.
This basically caused the split in the community.   There were those that said, no, code is law, 
these funds must remained hacked. The rest of the   community said, no, actually, we should just try 
and fix things. It was early on and made excuses.   These two different political viewpoints 
led to the two different blockchains that   we now have, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
Now, the big issue is that these hard forks,   there's always going to be contention. People 
will always make something political about them.   Because they're not governed by any automated 
consensus mechanism, it means that we're   beholden to soft forms of consensus, 
humans interacting, and that's without any   authority governing them or any economic system 
that they've all bought into. That leads to these   problems. Polkadot explicitly avoids that by 
making the protocol part of the consensus.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Polkadot, Kusama, it's more 
of alive, it's an alive protocol that has its own   meta governance. Because it's governance, and 
so are there risks with this? Because I have   heard previously, I've been in this space since 
2013 and I've heard that hard forks can be good,   because it's two communities doing what they 
want, or how they want? Is there any concerns from   having a forkless protocol?
GAVIN WOOD: It's not an argument   without merit. There are good reasons to 
try lots of different things. However,   schisms in a community are, as we've seen in 
the past, they're toxic. They ultimately lead to  negativity on every side, and that is 
generally against the happy innovation   that we see in a well-functioning 
community. I accept and actually believe in   running experiments, running multiple different 
potential ways forward at once, and then   competing them and somehow picking the best 
one and running with that, but then it needs   to be under some sort of order. It's no good just 
having explosive ways of trying multiple things,   because there's no path to getting back 
together again, and that's a big problem.  Whereas how we-- actually, Polkadot is one of the 
very first things that came to mind with Polkadot,   because it's a heterogenous sharded multi-chain. 
Because it's got these different shards,   these different parachains, and they can each 
be their own thing, they can each do their own   individual thing. It's a little bit like a 
critique of the United States that I read   in a few years ago in The Economist. It's 
basically this idea of a federated system   can run many different policy experiments in each 
of the different states, and the ones that work   can be elevated to federal status, and the 
ones that don't work can just be dropped.  It's the same in Polkadot. We can actually do 
the best things that are caused by hard forks,   which is to say, policy or protocol experiments, 
but we can do them at the level of parachains,   and we can run them all in parallel, one in 
each parachain, and the ones that tend to work,   we can elevate into Polkadot, the ones 
that don't work so well, we can just leave   these parachains or drop altogether.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: To make sure I'm   understanding this, you're saying that Polkadot 
acts a little bit like the federal government,   whereas each of the parachains are being like 
the states. They're getting like their meta   governance, they have their own rules. Say 
this again, you said they're heterogenous--  GAVIN WOOD: Sharded multi-chain.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Basically, again,   this means as opposed to Ethereum, each of these 
projects building on top of Ethereum, that they   are required to use the same blockchain logic 
as each other because they're uniformed things.   Whereas when we talk about parachains, they're not 
as uniformed. They're just getting their security   from this standard thing. They each have their own 
blockchain logic, their own rules, their own rule   sets, just like the states have their own rules 
and deciding if this is legal or that's legal.  That's one of the big differentiators between 
Polkadot and its heterogenous shards, meaning that   they have their own blockchain logic and anything 
happening on Ethereum, the projects happening   on-- the coins built on Ethereum, they're 
still beholden to the same type of logic.   Can you tell me the benefits of utilizing 
different logic or having the capability to use   different logic? I'm just unsure 
about how much more expansive that   world becomes by having the heterogenous chains.
GAVIN WOOD: Sure. You can think of like a smart   contract network like Ethereum, and there's 
a few others, they build in roughly the same   architecture, a little bit like the 
civil law system of the modern world.   You can get lawyers and they can make 
you have a contract, and this contract   can do lots of different things. I mean if you 
talk to a lawyer, you can generally get into   basically write whatever you want in the contract, 
there will be certain statutory requirements   that the overarching legal system places upon 
you, and it'll be different between legal systems.   For example, companies law in the UK, it 
makes it very difficult to give different   shareholder rights or restrict shareholder rights 
within a company. In the U, shareholder rights  are a lot more-- certainly in some states-- 
are a lot more flexible, you can basically   kill all rights or give all the rights 
to just a single shareholder or whatever.   That's not the case in a lot of other countries.
Now that you can think of Ethereum's generality   as being the generality that you 
get within a particular jurisdiction   over what kind of companies, what kind 
of civil law it has. It will exist within   that jurisdiction, and it won't be able to 
call upon civil law in other jurisdictions.   It will have the costs and the benefits of 
whatever the civil law is in that jurisdiction.  What Polkadot gives you is the ability to 
have basically whole other jurisdictions.   You're not required to exist just under one 
particular country's legal system, jurisprudence,   court system, lawyer framework. You can choose, 
you can make your own. You can say actually,   this blockchain is only going to have financial 
laws and the laws are going to be extremely   heavily regulated. You might have another 
blockchain that says, we have zero regulation.  Now, the Ethereum architecture, I should say, 
can't really do this because it's beholden to the   same underlying blockchain logic. It's a smart 
contract chain, it has particular definition   of what gas is, it has a particular definition of 
ether, it has a particular definition of how ether   and gas interact, it has a particular definition 
of how smart contracts, these different computer   programs interact. Though each of these things 
cannot be changed, they're baked into Ethereum,   and if you want to use Ethereum you have to buy 
in to this legal system, this crypto legal system.  With Polkadot, you can define your country however 
you want. You can define your laws however you   want. You can define your economy however you 
want. You're not going to have to buy into any   of this preexisting stuff. That leads to a huge 
amount more experimentation that's possible.  For example, if you don't want your users to have 
to hold your tokens in order to interact, but   instead only provide a verified Facebook identity 
to be able to interact, let's say once or twice   a day, you can do that. That's fine. You just 
write your blockchain logic so that instead of   verifying that when a transaction comes in, it's 
from a particular account that has some tokens,   that you're going to deduct in order to pay for 
the transaction to execute as Ethereum does,   you check to make sure that the account is 
referencing something that's on Facebook,   that the Facebook account is active, that it's 
been verified by Facebook or has a certain number   of friends or whatever it is you want, and that it 
hasn't made more than a few transactions already.  That's entirely possible, and it opens up like 
a whole new way of designing your applications   economics. To put it another way, you can 
implement Ethereum inside of Polkadot. You   can make a parachain. Indeed, there is a 
parachain, it's called Moonbeam. That is,   to all intents and purposes, the same as Ethereum. 
You can't make a smart contract in Ethereum   that does the same as Polkadot. You wouldn't 
be able to pay the gas costs. It would just be   impossibly expensive. That's the key difference.
Polkadot exists lower in the stack. Ethereum,   we call it a layer-one blockchain because it's 
notionally the first, and you build layer two   applications on top of it. You can think of 
Polkadot as a layer zero blockchain because   it sits underneath the level of Ethereum. Things 
like Ethereum, like Moonbeam and Acala are built  on top of Polkadot. Polkadot sits as a foundation 
layer that's just there to give security and   interoperability between its constituent 
chains. Doesn't do anything more than that.  SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: I've heard you say this 
before, and this is basically what you're   talking about. You said like Polkadot is a bet 
against maximalism? That's what you're touching   on right now, because you're saying these 
different jurisdictions have different rules,   but we're uncertain about what the best rule sets 
are, what the best jurisdictions are. Because of   this, because we know we're not certain yet what's 
the best rule set is, Polkadot allows you to   experiment with all the rule sets. I don't know 
if you want to expand on that a little bit more   about this idea of it's a bet against maximalism.
GAVIN WOOD: Yeah. There is definitely that thing   that we don't know what the best one is. I think 
even still, even if we didn't know what the best   one is, there isn't really a best one. There's 
maybe a best one for a particular application.   There's maybe a best one for a 
particular industry or domain,   but I don't think there's a best one, period. 
This idea that has been sold that there's one   blockchain for every application has been pushed 
certainly by elements of the Ethereum community.  I don't think it exists. I think 
Ethereum is a great chain for prototyping   blockchain experiments on, but I definitely-- 
if I were doing, for example, a supply chain   infrastructure, then why would I build it in smart 
contracts that have to be metered, that have this   really inefficient metering system? I know that 
what these contracts are. I know how long that   may take to execute. Why am I, every time a user 
is using them, re- measuring how long it takes?  Now, of course, if there are many different 
contracts, and you can't predict ahead of   time which one is going to be used, and anyone 
could introduce any contract at any time, like a   very general purpose, very prototype heavy system, 
then of course, metering is probably the only way   that that can happen, but for so many domain 
specific applications, it's just not needed. It's   too heavy duty. It's much better to actually 
make surprise, surprise, a domain-specific   blockchain. The problem is with domain-specific 
blockchains, they're time consuming to build.  Because they exist only as a blockchain, 
they can't talk to other blockchains very   easily. They don't integrate well. You 
can't compose them with each other very,   very easily. That's where Polkadot comes in. 
It's like Substrate, which is our blockchain   development toolkit, and makes it super easy 
to build your own blockchain. We're seeing   some great news articles about people building 
their own blockchain in various industries.  The one that I read most recently was this Korean 
music publisher that's building a blockchain for   Korean pop bands non-fungible tokens. Brilliant, 
lovely. Yeah, we're seeing these domain specific   blockchains come out, because they're just so 
much more efficient and much more performant than   doing things in a general purpose environment. 
Then of course, Polkadot allows these domain   specific blockchains to be deployed into Polkadot 
and talk to each other and share the security   together, again very important, so you don't 
have to pay your own validators or otherwise   have a very centralized proof of authority.
This is where the really interesting performance   benefits come from. It's not just about 
parallelizing all of it, which is already   great, because we've got for one, the Polkadot 
relay chain is a [?] of different blockchains,   each wearing away processing transactions all at 
the same time. Each of these chains, each of these   shards is domain specific. It's optimized to be 
highly performant for its specific use case. Now,   this is something that you don't get in a typical 
homogenous sharded system like Ethereum 2 where   each of the shards, although there might be 64 
of them, or whatever, but they're each doing the   same thing, each general purpose and that means 
that none of them are going to be very performant   for any of the tasks that they're doing.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: I see. Very interesting   stuff. I'd love to hear about your thoughts 
on what's happening in the space, in Polkadot,   Kusama, specifically over the next let's say 
a year or so. What are you anticipating? You   touched on the launching of these parachains, 
is that supposed to be happening soon? Tell me   a little bit about the future of Polkadot, Kusama.
GAVIN WOOD: Yeah. I mentioned Rococo, the testnet   for parachains has been launched in the last 
month and they are slowly onboarding each of   the parachain teams. I think we have about 15 of 
them or so, 15 or 20, they've already got their   stuff together, their software, their parachain, 
and they're ready to put it onto the testnet, onto   Rococo. Once we're happy that that code is running 
reasonably smoothly, then we will roll it out onto   Kusama, alongside of course the Kusama auctions, 
these slot auctions and the crowd loaning system,   so that people across the Kusama stake holding 
ecosystem can back their favorite parachains and   maybe reap some of the rewards that the parachain 
teams are offering them for their backing.  That's probably coming in the next month 
or two. Once we're happy that Kusama has--   everything's working as we expect in Kusama, 
and once the external audit is completed,   we have an external audit firm on retainer 
that's just basically churning through all   of this new code as we develop it. Once 
they're happy that this is safe and secure,   then we will be deploying it onto 
Polkadot. Our tentative goal for   that is by the end of this quarter, so 
fingers crossed that that comes through.  Once that is done, there will 
be an initial version of XEMP,   this cross chain message passing protocol. This is 
a way that these parachains can send messages to   each other, can communicate, as I mentioned, 
every six seconds, they can send messages.   That will be also within this first delivery, 
this first scope of delivery at the end of Q1   hopefully. Then over this first half of the 
year, we'll be optimizing this XEMP into a   more or less off-chain version of it, which 
basically dramatically increases the efficiency,   increases the number of messages that they 
can send to each other, decreases any of   the costs associated with it, and so on.
There are a few additional technologies.   One of them is called SPREE. This 
is a very exciting technology.   It stands for Secure Protected Runtime Execution 
Enclaves. What it basically means is that   you can have little programs that run inside these 
parachains. They all run separately, they all run   with the parachain in parallel to each other, so 
like you're managing 100 copies of this program   all running within the scope of the parachain, but 
it's the same program. It's like the best of both   worlds. You get heterogenous domain- specific, 
industry-specific blockchain sharding, but you   also get a little bit of the computer program in 
the shard that is the same across all the shards. It can do things like handle token balances, and 
you can send things like certain tokens or assets   between the shards with a guarantee that the 
code on the other side of the message is going   to execute correctly, execute as you imagine. A 
token, a very simple execution, reduce the balance   of one account, increase the balance of another 
account by the same amount, very simple transfer   operation, but we can imagine there might be a few 
more of these different little snippets of code   that have their own protected storage associated 
with them so they can maintain the balances.  This is very important so that parachains 
that don't trust each other's logic,   they might trust that their logic is 
executed correctly by Polkadot because   they will run into the same validator 
umbrella, but they don't necessarily trust   the logic itself is doing what they expect it to 
do. That when they said, hey, transfer this asset,   please, that it's actually going to reduce the 
balance of one account and increase of another.   What SPREE does is it gives them that guarantee. 
It allows the best of both worlds, your homogenate   sharding and your heterogenous sharding.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: We expect that in the near   future? When do you expect this SPREE to come?
GAVIN WOOD: That, I expect to land   Q3, I would say. Probably Q3 this year.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Do you imagine that   most of the fruits of your labor will be going by 
the end of this year? You're saying this the SPREE   thing you're talking about, all these parachains, 
do you expect to see defi basically existing   on Polkadot by the end of the year?
GAVIN WOOD: Yeah, I would hope so.   There's already plenty of defi chains. We've got 
some amazing teams, some really great talent out   there developing parachains. The great thing is 
that I think for me, it's out of my hands. Our job   here is to develop Polkadot and deliver parachains 
and make it as efficient and stable as possible.   It might be that when that's done that we will 
start playing around with developing a few   parachains of our own, and maybe developing 
some of the core technology on parachains,   but basically, our job is to deliver 
Polkadot as an application platform.  It's a wonderful ecosystem of, I said, about 
340 projects and counting that are developing   the layer-ones, these platforms. Polkadot is a 
platform of platform, or platforms themselves   that are providing the infrastructure for 
doing things like decentralized finance   and supply chain and registry tracking, 
NFT's and all this crazy imagine stuff.   That is some of which is going to be really well 
changing. Yeah, it's great. I have a huge amount   of confidence in many of these teams.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Perfect. Well,   thank you so much. Do you have any final thoughts,   any last things you'd like to say to 
the audience about Polkadot or how you   see the future, the ecosystem in general?
GAVIN WOOD: I think we're in an interesting   time for the ecosystem, particularly 
with Polkadot. Obviously, most of my   time and efforts have been focused on Polkadot. 
It's rare that I actually got a chance to look up   and look around and see what the rest of the world 
is doing. That's even more so in the last year  with the no conferences, and all 
the rest of it. I do think it's   really a great time to be in this ecosystem. We 
are entering Blockchain 3.0 slowly but surely.  It's important to look behind the claims to 
work out where the true actors in this golden   age are, and who were the maybe the ones that 
didn't quite make it into Blockchain 3.0 and   they're still at 2.5, because I think on the 
face of, it's not always so easy to distinguish.   It's really important to, if you're trying to 
make any judgment and evaluation, it's really   important to get a proper, developed a lead 
technical evaluation of where the protocols at,   and maybe also a proper game theoretic evaluation 
of what the protocol does, and not buy too much   into a lot of this hype surrounding it.
The only other thing I'd say is be aware of   the distinction, the difference between evolution 
and revolution. I know, as having done Ethereum,   we brought a new architecture into the world 
with Ethereum, this idea of the Ethereum Virtual   Machine, the idea of smart contracts. Proud as 
I am about that, it is ultimately a technology   that's now six, seven years old. We're still 
seeing blockchains sticking to the architecture,   sticking to this very smart contract, gas 
consuming, dynamically metered architecture   that we introduced in Ethereum way back then.
That's all very well, and you will see   evolution on that. You will see people improving 
performance. You will see some changes to things   like transaction propagation, just trying to eke 
out that improved level of transaction throughput.   Ultimately, if it's using the same architecture, 
it's probably not going to be a revolutionary   difference in a revolutionary innovation. 
You've got to look beyond that architecture   to really find the gems in this golden age.
SEBASTIAN MOONJAVA: Great. Hey, thank you   so much. I really appreciate it. Great advice. 
Great knowledge. Thank you so much, Gavin Wood.  GAVIN WOOD: Thanks for having me on the show. NICK
